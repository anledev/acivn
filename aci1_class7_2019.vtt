WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.920
All right, sorry I got sick, but I had a good sleep for two days.

00:16.440 --> 00:19.080
And thanks to Geshe Lotar for teaching.

00:21.120 --> 00:28.000
Geshe Lotar is the nephew of my root Tibetan Lama, Ken Rinpoche Geshe Losantarjun, and

00:30.880 --> 00:41.000
he grew up with Rinpoche from the time he was a child, and so they're kind of similar,

00:42.600 --> 00:44.600
like very tough,

00:45.440 --> 00:47.240
and

00:47.240 --> 00:51.920
he has served as the Gikul of Sarame

00:52.920 --> 00:56.680
monastery, which is part of one of the three largest monasteries in the world, and

00:56.680 --> 00:58.680
and

00:59.560 --> 01:07.720
that's the vice abbot position, and he did a good job. He didn't beat up too many people. That's the debate master.

01:08.880 --> 01:10.880
Sometimes they carry things, and

01:12.760 --> 01:14.760
he worked

01:15.280 --> 01:22.240
he was the master of Gyalong house, which is one of the 12 colleges of Sarame for, I don't know,

01:23.080 --> 01:25.080
probably 30 years,

01:25.080 --> 01:29.000
and maybe a small table, big at that, small table?

01:31.120 --> 01:33.120
Small table, would be good.

01:35.360 --> 01:37.360
And

01:37.560 --> 01:44.080
he brought up countless monks, he taught them how to tie their robes, which is not a small thing to teach somebody,

01:45.000 --> 01:48.440
because it's very complicated, and if you do it wrong, it falls down.

01:50.280 --> 01:52.280
And

01:52.800 --> 01:57.560
he, I don't know, I would say, I don't know, 500 young monks he trained, and

01:58.920 --> 02:00.720
amazing lifetime.

02:00.720 --> 02:02.720
He served my teacher

02:03.880 --> 02:05.880
with his whole heart, his whole life.

02:08.040 --> 02:10.040
I'll show you how

02:10.040 --> 02:11.800
how much

02:11.800 --> 02:16.000
love he had for my teacher. Geshe-la had a green card, American green card,

02:16.720 --> 02:21.000
and he came to stay with us for, I don't know, five, six years, and

02:22.440 --> 02:24.840
then Rinpoche said, they need you back at the monastery,

02:26.360 --> 02:27.880
and

02:27.880 --> 02:32.600
then he asked me, am I going to lose my green card? I said, yeah. He said, okay.

02:33.880 --> 02:37.080
So I think he's the first person in the world to give back his green card,

02:38.440 --> 02:41.480
and he just went home, and he went to train more monks, and

02:42.520 --> 02:44.520
so he's been there since then,

02:45.320 --> 02:48.520
and without him I cannot do the Geshe course,

02:49.480 --> 02:52.200
because there's a lot of rules that we don't know,

02:53.480 --> 02:57.400
countless rules in the monastery that we don't know about from foreigners,

02:58.920 --> 03:00.360
and

03:00.360 --> 03:05.560
even on the day of the Geshe exam, he's tying all these things, I'm chab lu kye duwa,

03:07.400 --> 03:10.280
he's tying things on me like I'm getting married,

03:12.360 --> 03:14.360
and it's getting heavier and heavier, and

03:14.840 --> 03:20.920
then he ties this big bag on my waist, and it covers down to your knees here, I said, what's that?

03:21.960 --> 03:23.640
Chab lu ...

03:23.640 --> 03:25.720
What's a chab lu ... water bag?

03:26.760 --> 03:31.000
I said, why do you have to wear it during your Geshe exam? He says, nobody knows,

03:34.440 --> 03:36.440
but you have to wear it.

03:37.080 --> 03:39.080
Then like stuff like that I would never ever

03:39.780 --> 03:46.120
understand, so without him I wouldn't be here, okay, so you should thank him a thousand times.

03:59.880 --> 04:03.080
He also built many places for the monks,

04:03.400 --> 04:10.920
many ... what do you call them? Dormitories, yeah, difficult job, and his assistant Ngo Yuen Tan is a very good

04:11.640 --> 04:13.640
candidate for Geshe soon,

04:14.120 --> 04:16.120
and we hope he has good luck

04:17.320 --> 04:21.240
and shows Sarah Jay we are better monks than Sarah Jay,

04:22.760 --> 04:24.760
okay, just kidding,

04:27.080 --> 04:31.400
and I heard he's going to teach us some chanting in the next few days, so

04:32.360 --> 04:37.560
that would be nice, okay, and I heard he's going to give a talk in Sedona,

04:40.040 --> 04:47.400
so he agreed, and Geshe-la has agreed to give a talk there, Sedona laya ... that's a tori lapra laya,

04:48.760 --> 04:53.240
lecture yang kya nyi she ... free rey da, free ...

04:53.880 --> 04:55.880
dan lang ...

04:59.720 --> 05:04.200
All right, we're doing class seven, I'd like to thank John Brady for teaching class six last night,

05:05.160 --> 05:07.080
and

05:07.080 --> 05:08.760
it's very nice to have

05:08.760 --> 05:10.760
backup,

05:11.000 --> 05:16.040
and class seven is about the second of the three principal paths, which is what?

05:17.320 --> 05:19.880
Yeah, the wish for enlightenment, capital W, okay?

05:20.840 --> 05:24.680
So that class, I think it has two or three classes, and

05:25.880 --> 05:27.880
they're going to talk about why

05:28.680 --> 05:33.080
do you want to reach bodhichitta, what's so cool about bodhichitta, so

05:39.160 --> 05:42.280
I'd like to first talk about

05:44.200 --> 05:48.360
an Arya's experience of bodhichitta, okay, someone who has seen emptiness directly,

05:49.320 --> 05:51.320
and

05:52.760 --> 05:54.760
so

05:55.080 --> 06:01.080
the way it happens is that, you know, the five paths, path of

06:03.060 --> 06:06.440
accumulation, path of preparation, path of seeing,

06:07.240 --> 06:11.240
path of habituation, path of no more learning, and then

06:12.760 --> 06:15.000
in the first path, basically our learning

06:15.960 --> 06:21.400
different versions of the pen, or, and you are, sorry,

06:24.280 --> 06:31.640
usually they say a good disaster in your life, okay, like if your mother dies at your side or something like that, so then you

06:32.600 --> 06:37.640
get interested in helping all beings, you get interested in getting out of this life,

06:39.080 --> 06:43.240
and then the second path, chor lam, path of preparation, you learn

06:44.200 --> 06:50.040
basically you learn four kinds of emptiness, two that relate to things and two that relate to yourself,

06:51.080 --> 06:52.760
and

06:52.760 --> 06:58.440
if you reach the third one, which is where it starts to relate to yourself, where the pen starts to relate to yourself,

06:59.240 --> 07:01.400
then we talked about it, you reach

07:02.920 --> 07:05.480
gokpa for what, you reach a cessation for

07:06.680 --> 07:09.800
lower realms, you can't be born in the lower realms, so that's a very

07:10.920 --> 07:12.920
doable goal

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
that an ACI teacher should try to

07:15.800 --> 07:18.840
bring their student to, and it may be the best thing that

07:19.640 --> 07:23.080
anyone ever did for them, so as an ACI teacher you have a cool

07:24.420 --> 07:26.420
responsibility, you have a cool

07:27.320 --> 07:31.080
potential that you could protect someone for the rest of their lifetimes

07:31.800 --> 07:34.200
if you teach it well, if you teach the pen well,

07:35.000 --> 07:38.840
and I think that itself is a good reason to be an ACI teacher,

07:39.800 --> 07:43.320
and I hope you'll all do that, you can help countless people,

07:44.840 --> 07:49.480
and they'll all thank you later, they don't thank you when you're doing it 500 times, but

07:50.600 --> 07:52.600
later they'll thank you.

07:53.080 --> 07:56.280
Then in the last moments of chor lam, chor lam chok chok,

07:57.400 --> 08:00.520
which is called highest thing in the world, but it's the highest thing in the normal world,

08:03.880 --> 08:05.560
you might be

08:05.560 --> 08:07.560
making a tea for your teacher,

08:08.200 --> 08:10.920
and looking at a pot on the stove,

08:12.120 --> 08:16.360
and there are many conditions you need, right? You have to be studying hard,

08:17.240 --> 08:19.240
you have to have a good teacher,

08:19.880 --> 08:21.880
you have to be serving

08:22.600 --> 08:24.600
poor people, old people, sick people,

08:25.400 --> 08:27.880
you have to be meditating an hour every day, okay?

08:28.760 --> 08:30.760
But if all of those are

08:30.820 --> 08:32.440
complete,

08:32.440 --> 08:35.800
then suddenly you realize that when you look at a pot on the stove,

08:37.560 --> 08:40.760
you're not seeing a pot on the stove, you're looking at maybe silver color,

08:41.720 --> 08:43.720
and a circle, and a black stick,

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
and then a seed is opening in your mind,

08:48.200 --> 08:50.200
and when the seed opens it

08:51.080 --> 08:58.040
it covers the object and it makes it into a pot, and if the seed was a lower seed, like if I had a

08:59.080 --> 09:01.000
an ant seed,

09:01.000 --> 09:02.360
then the same

09:02.360 --> 09:05.640
circle, the same color, it would be a mountain, right? Hot

09:06.200 --> 09:08.200
burning mountain.

09:08.200 --> 09:10.520
So it depends on your seeds, right? And

09:11.560 --> 09:14.040
when you reach DBYOR LAM CHOS CHO, this highest

09:15.000 --> 09:16.280
thing in the world

09:16.280 --> 09:18.280
at the path of preparation,

09:18.600 --> 09:20.600
for the first time

09:20.600 --> 09:24.200
you see a seed opening in your mind, and you have them opening

09:25.160 --> 09:27.160
how many?

09:27.220 --> 09:29.220
65 per second,

09:29.480 --> 09:33.080
but you don't see it, you can't see it, so you have to be meditating a lot,

09:34.120 --> 09:35.320
and

09:35.320 --> 09:37.320
your whole life since you were born,

09:37.800 --> 09:39.800
things are coming from you,

09:40.260 --> 09:42.360
65 pictures a second coming from you,

09:43.160 --> 09:45.640
but it's so fast you couldn't see it, okay?

09:46.440 --> 09:47.720
Then

09:47.720 --> 09:49.480
at that point

09:49.480 --> 09:53.560
you see it for the first time, and it's kind of a fun moment in your life because you're like,

09:54.200 --> 09:55.640
yeah,

09:55.640 --> 09:58.120
Buddhism's right, you know, and

09:58.920 --> 10:02.280
everything they taught me is correct, and you feel kind of

10:03.080 --> 10:05.080
happy and amazed, and

10:06.280 --> 10:09.160
it changes your life forever, you never forget that moment, okay?

10:11.560 --> 10:17.080
Then maybe you go serve the tea to your teacher and go to the temple and meditate, and then

10:19.400 --> 10:21.400
in meditation, I would say within

10:22.120 --> 10:24.760
two hours after the seed opening experience,

10:25.640 --> 10:28.440
you will see emptiness directly, okay? And

10:30.440 --> 10:33.560
that's about 20 minutes, although you don't know how time is passing,

10:34.520 --> 10:36.520
and

10:36.520 --> 10:38.520
you have communion with the

10:39.060 --> 10:41.320
emptiness, and it's higher

10:42.200 --> 10:45.000
reality, that's all around us, but you never saw it before,

10:46.040 --> 10:47.560
and

10:47.560 --> 10:49.560
can you think I did it?

10:50.280 --> 10:54.840
No, because that's not emptiness, okay? So only you can see emptiness at that moment, you cannot

10:55.560 --> 10:57.560
think to yourself, oh I did it, you know?

10:58.440 --> 11:00.440
chu la chu shakpa

11:01.240 --> 11:03.640
water poured into water, okay? And

11:05.240 --> 11:06.760
then

11:06.760 --> 11:10.440
it's a very, very heavy karma, very expensive karma to stay there,

11:12.600 --> 11:14.600
like having a girlfriend is heavy karma,

11:15.880 --> 11:17.880
difficult to keep them,

11:18.760 --> 11:21.800
but this is much more, okay? And it will

11:22.600 --> 11:27.720
burn out very fast, okay? What's that thing you said Stanley? Shavings, wood shavings

11:27.720 --> 11:29.720
from the Abhidharma.

11:31.720 --> 11:33.720
Yeah, it burns hot and it burns

11:34.440 --> 11:36.680
fast, and it finishes, and then you come down,

11:37.960 --> 11:39.960
and then you start to have

11:41.000 --> 11:47.640
a bunch of very cool experiences, very very cool experiences. Later they were grouped together into the four

11:48.440 --> 11:50.440
Arya truths, we're not going to call them

11:51.560 --> 11:55.400
noble truths, because that's a bad translation of Arya, Arya means a

11:56.120 --> 11:58.120
higher, okay? Higher truths.

11:58.680 --> 12:00.680
So you will have these

12:01.480 --> 12:04.680
bunch of cool experiences, it takes about, it's called je tong bye shi,

12:06.120 --> 12:09.960
which means after the direct experience, and it takes about

12:10.920 --> 12:13.080
maybe an hour, maybe a little bit less, and you

12:13.960 --> 12:16.360
have all these amazing experiences, like

12:18.040 --> 12:20.040
I guess the first one is you say, I did it,

12:20.920 --> 12:23.720
I saw emptiness direct me, and that emptiness

12:24.680 --> 12:26.680
which you perceive

12:28.680 --> 12:31.880
is also confirmation of the Buddha, okay? So that's the core

12:32.840 --> 12:36.920
of the Buddha, and so you can say after that that I met the Buddha.

12:37.560 --> 12:39.560
So we're all Buddhist, but

12:40.520 --> 12:45.400
we never met a Buddha, right? The Buddha, historical Buddha, or many people are Christian,

12:46.520 --> 12:50.120
but if you ask them did Jesus exist, we have to say I'm not sure,

12:50.920 --> 12:53.080
I think so, there's a lot of books about it.

12:54.600 --> 12:56.600
And there's a tradition,

12:57.080 --> 13:00.280
but to meet Jesus face to face, or to meet a Buddha face to face,

13:00.920 --> 13:03.240
then that's different, right? And you get this

13:04.660 --> 13:10.360
intense, more happy feeling that you confirmed Buddhism. I told you guys, my boss

13:11.720 --> 13:13.720
in my diamond company,

13:14.760 --> 13:15.800
he,

13:15.800 --> 13:19.000
so I had a deal with him that I would give all my money to the

13:19.700 --> 13:21.160
monastery,

13:21.160 --> 13:23.160
like 90 percent, and

13:24.040 --> 13:26.440
every six months I would go to his office and

13:27.320 --> 13:29.480
give him the number, and he would give me,

13:30.280 --> 13:33.320
he would donate six months salary to Sarah, me,

13:34.680 --> 13:38.760
to feed people, give them houses, and I did that for 19 years.

13:39.560 --> 13:41.560
And

13:41.640 --> 13:44.920
so the first time we did it, he said, you know what, I'll throw in an extra

13:46.260 --> 13:48.680
ten thousand dollars, you know? I'm like, whoa,

13:49.640 --> 13:51.240
that's so cool.

13:51.240 --> 13:53.720
I mean, later I learned I made him hundreds of millions of dollars,

13:55.960 --> 13:57.960
but still it was pretty cool.

13:58.200 --> 14:03.640
And so, you know, I was, thank you very much. And then Rinpoche,

14:04.440 --> 14:06.440
our teacher,

14:06.840 --> 14:10.360
he would know what day I'm going to ask for the money, he'd say, good luck, you know, good luck,

14:10.840 --> 14:12.840
I hope he gives you more, you know?

14:13.160 --> 14:15.960
And then when I came home, he'd be waiting in the kitchen, he'd say, you know,

14:16.840 --> 14:20.600
how much extra? I'd say, oh, ten thousand, ah, great,

14:21.160 --> 14:23.080
you know, and

14:23.080 --> 14:24.520
so

14:24.520 --> 14:30.040
I remember during the geshe degree, you're supposed to make a big gift in the monastery, so I was going to give

14:31.320 --> 14:35.240
a debate ground, a new debate ground, which is, at the time was fifty thousand dollars, maybe,

14:36.120 --> 14:38.440
maybe about two hundred thousand now, something, and

14:40.280 --> 14:46.200
so I told my two bosses, he and his wife, you know, this is a special one,

14:47.160 --> 14:49.480
you know, I have to give a lot of money this time,

14:50.200 --> 14:54.120
you know, and I saw they have this secret language with their hands

14:55.160 --> 14:57.160
when they're doing deals,

14:57.400 --> 15:00.360
they were touching fingers, and they're going, but I saw it, you know, I'm like,

15:02.360 --> 15:04.280
and the wife's going,

15:04.280 --> 15:06.280
the boss is going,

15:06.280 --> 15:08.440
and they had a hand fight for a while,

15:09.480 --> 15:12.040
and then he said, you know what, we'll give you fifty thousand,

15:12.760 --> 15:15.800
we'll donate fifty thousand extra, you know, then I said,

15:16.920 --> 15:18.920
I really appreciate it, you know, I,

15:20.040 --> 15:22.200
but can I ask you a question, and he said, what?

15:23.240 --> 15:27.480
I said, you know, you're from Israel, you are Jewish, everybody, hundred percent

15:28.280 --> 15:30.760
in Israel are Jewish, right Ronit? I mean, ninety-nine,

15:31.960 --> 15:33.960
okay, ninety-four, and

15:36.040 --> 15:38.040
you're all Jewish there, and

15:38.920 --> 15:41.480
you're strong Jewish people, you know, why you

15:42.600 --> 15:46.200
give money for the Buddhist monastery, why you want to give me extra money?

15:47.160 --> 15:50.280
Then he looked at me and he said, you never know who's right,

15:52.760 --> 15:55.240
you know, could be any religion is right,

15:56.040 --> 15:58.600
so the safest thing is to give money to each one,

15:59.480 --> 16:02.200
you know, why am I talking about that?

16:04.200 --> 16:06.200
Yeah, you confirm you're in the right,

16:07.320 --> 16:09.320
you're on the right team,

16:09.320 --> 16:11.720
okay, you're like, ah, hey, yeah, I hit it,

16:12.520 --> 16:15.640
you know, there is a Buddha, and there is emptiness, and

16:16.760 --> 16:20.040
so there's a lot of cool experiences, you see your future Buddhahood,

16:21.320 --> 16:23.320
about five hundred years out,

16:24.600 --> 16:28.300
and it's defined by a number of lifetimes, it's called the sipalendubawa,

16:29.480 --> 16:36.200
which means seven lifetimes, later I found it in the Abhidharma, later I found it, you can check it,

16:38.520 --> 16:42.360
but within seven lifetimes you will be a Buddha, and you see your Buddhahood

16:43.560 --> 16:45.560
directly, which is very cool,

16:46.280 --> 16:50.280
and then you know you will take care of countless beings on this planet,

16:51.400 --> 16:53.400
and many planets, and then

16:55.240 --> 16:57.240
there's a cool experience,

16:58.360 --> 17:01.880
you still have your eyes closed, but you're not seeing emptiness anymore,

17:02.840 --> 17:04.840
this is the four ariya truth time,

17:05.880 --> 17:07.880
and

17:08.520 --> 17:10.520
you see like the face of your mother

17:11.640 --> 17:13.960
comes up in your mind, like, what do you call?

17:14.920 --> 17:16.760
like a

17:16.760 --> 17:19.640
film, on an old film, on a reel, comes up,

17:20.360 --> 17:22.600
and you see your mom, and you say, I love you mom, and

17:23.320 --> 17:24.920
I will take care of you,

17:24.920 --> 17:31.160
then you see your dad comes up next, and you say, dad, I love you, I'll take care of you, and your dad's like, okay,

17:32.040 --> 17:35.080
and then your brothers, and then all your friends,

17:36.120 --> 17:38.440
and then it starts to speed up, like a

17:39.960 --> 17:41.960
what's that gambling machine?

17:42.280 --> 17:48.200
slot machine, like that, it's spinning like that, and you start to see more and more people's faces, and

17:49.240 --> 17:51.240
then you start to see people you don't know,

17:52.040 --> 17:54.280
and you say, I love you, I will take care of you, I love you,

17:54.280 --> 17:58.920
I will take care of you, and then it speeds up even more, and you start to see, okay,

17:59.800 --> 18:01.800
I know you don't believe it, but anyway, you heard it,

18:04.280 --> 18:05.400
birds,

18:05.400 --> 18:09.320
animals, fish, one by one, each one in this world,

18:10.120 --> 18:13.800
you know, one by one coming, you know, and it should take a long time, right?

18:14.440 --> 18:16.600
I think there's a hundred billion animals on this earth,

18:17.640 --> 18:19.640
but because of emptiness,

18:20.040 --> 18:22.040
time gets faster,

18:22.520 --> 18:24.760
so you can sit with someone for a few

18:25.800 --> 18:28.120
seconds, and say, I love you, and I'll take care of you,

18:29.000 --> 18:33.560
and you do all the living creatures on this planet, even amoebas,

18:34.360 --> 18:36.360
I don't know if it's stomach amoebas,

18:36.760 --> 18:38.760
I think we should leave them out,

18:39.320 --> 18:46.200
but you see all those creatures, and then the weird thing, you start seeing people on other planets,

18:47.240 --> 18:49.240
and

18:50.040 --> 18:53.800
one by one, and you do the same thing, and then it goes to another planet, another planet,

18:54.600 --> 18:56.600
and you finish

18:57.700 --> 18:59.700
uncountable planets, okay?

19:00.440 --> 19:03.400
Each person, and each fish, and each animal,

19:04.520 --> 19:08.040
and then you come down, and it's only ten minutes later or something, you know,

19:08.760 --> 19:10.760
and you're like, wow,

19:11.400 --> 19:14.520
and I always tell people, I think after that happens to you,

19:15.560 --> 19:17.560
how can you have a bad day?

19:17.720 --> 19:19.800
You know, like you're throwing up all day, but

19:20.760 --> 19:23.880
you can't have a totally bad day, you know, because

19:24.920 --> 19:26.920
it's so cool

19:27.160 --> 19:30.760
to know what your future is, and to know what you have to do, okay?

19:31.640 --> 19:33.480
And

19:33.480 --> 19:36.220
that is the experience of bodhichitta

19:36.300 --> 19:40.700
by an Arya, okay? By someone who just saw emptiness, okay?

19:41.660 --> 19:43.820
And

19:43.820 --> 19:50.780
it's called, thek chen sem kye, say thek chen sem kye, okay? Highest Mahayana experience of bodhichitta.

19:53.180 --> 19:55.340
And after that, your whole life changes,

19:59.180 --> 20:01.980
and there's, in the

20:03.580 --> 20:05.580
reading I gave you, there's

20:06.700 --> 20:08.460
nine

20:08.460 --> 20:10.460
different cool things that happen,

20:11.260 --> 20:13.260
and I thought I would give you twenty-two more.

20:15.260 --> 20:17.260
Those come from Maitreya,

20:18.460 --> 20:20.460
from the Abhisamalankara, okay?

20:25.900 --> 20:29.340
From the first chapter, so, you know,

20:30.140 --> 20:33.740
I don't know how long I can teach tonight, let's see, but I'm going to try to do those

20:34.540 --> 20:36.540
nine, which are official on your homework,

20:37.580 --> 20:42.780
and twenty-two, which are unofficial on your homework, okay? And if we don't finish the twenty-two tonight, we'll do it tomorrow, okay?

20:46.060 --> 20:49.500
All right, so now I'm going to go through the homework, which is not very long,

20:52.700 --> 20:54.700
say cham chu gyi sem,

20:55.260 --> 20:57.260
yeah, cham chu means

20:57.260 --> 20:59.260
Buddha, Buddhahood, cham chu.

21:00.620 --> 21:03.100
Anybody want to give me the parts for fifty dollars?

21:04.540 --> 21:08.060
I'd make bets with them, money. Seiji, chung,

21:09.900 --> 21:11.900
I make, kaysara,

21:12.460 --> 21:16.940
dama shak gyurye, le yin ya puchi gyena ngam ari ko mong nga chu tam pu te gyin,

21:17.900 --> 21:20.780
didn't they love gyurye ngay, kye ran ma tok,

21:21.740 --> 21:23.740
Seiji,

21:23.900 --> 21:25.900
did you raise your hand, or are you just scratching?

21:27.580 --> 21:29.900
Okay, okay, come on, what's cham chu?

21:30.540 --> 21:32.540
Wait, not you either.

21:37.420 --> 21:39.420
Ay ya,

21:39.420 --> 21:41.420
you got another word for Buddha, okay?

21:42.060 --> 21:43.980
Say cham chu,

21:43.980 --> 21:50.940
cham means clean away all your bad deeds, all your bad obstacles, all your obstacles to Buddhahood, chu means

21:52.140 --> 21:57.500
understand everything, chu means understand everything, cham chu means Buddha, okay? Cham chu gyi sem means,

21:58.460 --> 22:02.700
I just saved fifty dollars by the way, yeah, mind of enlightenment, so

22:03.900 --> 22:08.860
as you know, I don't like some of the translations that you see, one is enlightened mind,

22:09.980 --> 22:14.860
the reason I don't like it is it, to me enlightened mind means you're already enlightened,

22:15.420 --> 22:18.860
but that's not what it means, and I don't want to say Buddha mind

22:20.140 --> 22:23.980
or something like that, it doesn't even mean the seed for that, it doesn't mean that,

22:24.780 --> 22:28.140
so I think it's a wrong translation, I think if the person studied

22:29.980 --> 22:34.300
well, they wouldn't translate it that way, so it's a wish for enlightenment, okay?

22:35.820 --> 22:37.820
Word, you can do the definition,

22:40.620 --> 22:42.860
um, no, um is not in the definition,

22:42.860 --> 22:44.860
nice,

22:51.340 --> 22:53.340
definition by

22:53.340 --> 22:58.300
Maitreya, yeah, sem kyi ma ni, what is bodhichitta? shen dun chir, for the sake of all other beings,

22:59.100 --> 23:02.620
yang da dzokpay chang chud dun, I wish to reach total enlightenment, okay?

23:03.420 --> 23:08.940
It doesn't mean you're enlightened already, and it doesn't mean some kind of part of you which is already Buddha, it doesn't mean that, okay?

23:09.820 --> 23:12.780
So I don't like to call it enlightened mind, I like to call it wish for enlightenment,

23:13.500 --> 23:16.140
and I like to put a capital W, because I think it's cool,

23:16.860 --> 23:19.340
I didn't have time to fix the homework yet, I'm sorry,

23:20.220 --> 23:22.220
okay,

23:22.220 --> 23:27.500
so that's your first question, those of you who want to do the Tibetan, there's two words, chang chud kyi sem,

23:28.140 --> 23:30.140
what is the Sanskrit?

23:30.860 --> 23:33.660
Yeah, bodhichitta, so bodhi does mean enlightenment,

23:34.460 --> 23:36.460
and chitta does mean the mind,

23:36.940 --> 23:44.380
paruski gavari chitta yo, ya chitta yo, ya chitta yo, chitta, there are many words in Russian, still have this root

23:45.100 --> 23:47.100
to read or to calculate,

23:48.380 --> 23:52.940
and it's still chitta, that comes, Russian is much closer to Sanskrit

23:53.740 --> 23:56.620
than other languages, must mean Russians are smarter, I think.

23:58.860 --> 24:05.260
Okay, there's another word which is a common word for bodhichitta called sem kye, say sem kye,

24:06.620 --> 24:08.620
this is chitta utpada,

24:10.540 --> 24:16.220
it means to grow the mind or to grow the wish to save all beings, okay, so there are synonyms,

24:16.860 --> 24:18.860
you can call it either one, okay?

24:19.340 --> 24:21.340
I thought you would like to know some

24:22.860 --> 24:26.860
other divisions of bodhichitta that are not in the reading and they're not in the homework, okay?

24:27.820 --> 24:31.660
But if you go to the monastery and they talk about them, you'll get confused,

24:32.620 --> 24:37.340
okay, so I thought I'll just cover them for you, they're not on your homework so you don't have to learn them or write them down.

24:41.980 --> 24:43.980
Ready?

24:44.940 --> 24:46.940
How about

24:46.940 --> 24:52.780
say buram kyi shumba tabu sem kye,

24:58.700 --> 25:00.700
buram means sugarcane,

25:01.420 --> 25:04.380
and there's two kinds of sugarcane bodhichitta, okay?

25:04.940 --> 25:11.180
There's two versions of sugarcane bodhichitta, and that's like a preliminary preliminary bodhichitta, okay, before you reach

25:12.300 --> 25:14.300
the first path even, okay?

25:15.180 --> 25:17.180
One is called

25:18.140 --> 25:25.180
bodhichitta similar to the skin of the sugarcane, the outside part,

25:26.460 --> 25:28.060
and then

25:28.060 --> 25:32.060
buram kyi shing tabu sem kye means like the

25:32.780 --> 25:34.620
buram kyi ro tabu,

25:34.620 --> 25:38.780
like the sweet taste inside, and you see kids in India, you know, there's a

25:40.140 --> 25:42.860
people grind up sugarcane on a little

25:43.820 --> 25:48.300
like cart, and they have these glasses that they haven't washed for like 20 years, and

25:48.940 --> 25:53.820
people come and take a drink, and you get diarrhea about five minutes later,

25:54.460 --> 25:56.460
but it tastes good.

25:56.980 --> 26:01.420
So one is called sweet like the skin of the

26:02.020 --> 26:07.460
sugarcane, and one is called sweet like the inside of the sugarcane, okay?

26:08.140 --> 26:10.140
And the first one is

26:10.780 --> 26:12.780
is when you go to a class

26:13.500 --> 26:16.300
and the teacher teaches you about bodhichitta, okay?

26:16.940 --> 26:22.460
tu jung gi shing tabu, you just heard about it, like you're still thinking about it, okay?

26:23.180 --> 26:25.180
So in the class

26:25.260 --> 26:32.220
you get bodhichitta, but it's not real bodhichitta, it's just what we call sugarcane bodhichitta, two kinds, okay?

26:32.940 --> 26:34.940
When you just heard about it

26:35.420 --> 26:37.420
for the first few times we call it

26:38.140 --> 26:39.900
skin, okay?

26:39.900 --> 26:45.020
We call it hearing wisdom, right? Just in the class you heard about it, and you start to think about it, okay?

26:45.900 --> 26:48.540
Then when you go home and you think about it

26:49.660 --> 26:54.780
and then you meditate on it, that's called sam chung, gom chung gi sherab, so you

26:55.660 --> 26:58.460
by thinking about it by yourself at home

26:59.260 --> 27:01.260
or in your car, okay?

27:02.300 --> 27:04.620
And then meditating on it you get, which one?

27:05.020 --> 27:06.220
Bodhichitta.

27:06.220 --> 27:10.220
Yeah, you get the taste, the real taste, you still don't have bodhichitta, but it's called

27:11.020 --> 27:13.580
inside sugarcane bodhichitta, okay? So that's a

27:14.300 --> 27:18.460
that's a kind of bodhichitta you might see in the scriptures, but you don't know what it is, okay?

27:19.180 --> 27:21.180
That's a little bit different, okay?

27:21.580 --> 27:23.580
Then there's

27:24.060 --> 27:26.060
dun dam sem kye, say dun dam sem kye

27:27.900 --> 27:33.100
ultimate bodhichitta, okay? And that's very confusing, that means what?

27:33.180 --> 27:37.260
The direct perception of emptiness, okay? It has nothing to do with

27:38.220 --> 27:40.220
love or anything like that, lower

27:41.100 --> 27:44.540
arhats can have it, lower arias can have it, it doesn't mean

27:46.060 --> 27:48.780
love like that, it means the direct perception of emptiness, okay?

27:49.500 --> 27:51.500
So ultimate bodhichitta means

27:52.620 --> 27:54.620
the direct perception of emptiness.

27:59.340 --> 28:01.420
Yeah,

28:01.420 --> 28:08.540
then if you get some, if you're a buddha, are you still a bodhisattva? By the way, when you get some, when you get bodhichitta,

28:08.540 --> 28:11.420
you're a bodhisattva, real bodhisattva, bodhichitta,

28:12.220 --> 28:14.540
then you're a bodhi-, when you have that experience, for example,

28:15.580 --> 28:17.420
about all the

28:17.420 --> 28:20.700
beings in the universe, then you're a real bodhisattva, okay?

28:22.460 --> 28:24.460
Can you still be a bodhisattva and be a buddha?

28:25.420 --> 28:27.900
Yeah, you don't give up your bodhisattva license

28:28.780 --> 28:32.780
when you get to your buddha license, you get to keep both cards,

28:33.660 --> 28:37.260
okay? Now you're a bodhisattva who's a buddha, okay? Like that.

28:41.900 --> 28:45.100
And there's a debate, and I'm not sure where I stand on it,

28:46.940 --> 28:48.940
my Trayas text, Abhisamangara

28:49.820 --> 28:51.500
says that

28:51.500 --> 28:53.500
to enter the first path

28:53.900 --> 28:55.900
on the Mahayana track,

28:56.300 --> 28:57.980
you have to have

28:57.980 --> 29:00.220
SEMS KYI CHUN MA MA YIN PA, say CHUN MA MA YIN PA,

29:01.580 --> 29:02.940
the real one,

29:02.940 --> 29:04.780
so

29:04.780 --> 29:08.620
they say when you reach the first path, the personal disaster path

29:09.740 --> 29:10.620
on

29:10.620 --> 29:12.620
Mahayana track,

29:12.620 --> 29:15.260
you are a bodhisattva, okay? I'm not sure about it,

29:16.140 --> 29:19.020
I'm not sure about it. I learned all my Tibetan from Geshe-la,

29:19.980 --> 29:21.980
he talked to me for many years,

29:22.940 --> 29:26.700
he's so nice, he just talked to you, whatever you say he pretends to understand it,

29:27.660 --> 29:29.980
and we had this relationship for many years,

29:31.580 --> 29:36.700
or he would correct me, and that's why I can talk, it wasn't Kam Rinpoche because he won't talk to me,

29:37.500 --> 29:40.220
so, but Geshe-la always talked to me, and

29:41.340 --> 29:44.940
so when I need to know a word I will ask him, what does CHUN MA mean?

29:48.140 --> 29:50.140
And then I remember we were

29:51.100 --> 29:58.140
driving somewhere and we stopped at Howard Johnson, and to have a Tibetan tea,

30:00.060 --> 30:01.740
and

30:01.740 --> 30:05.340
they serve him fake, what do you call it, fake cream?

30:06.220 --> 30:09.340
They call it cream dream or something like that, it's a cream nightmare actually,

30:10.140 --> 30:12.140
it's fake milk,

30:13.020 --> 30:19.660
it's mostly chalk and water, and they'll give it to you in the cheaper restaurants if you ask for milk, so

30:21.100 --> 30:27.900
he said, ah, now I'll teach you a new word about bodhichitta, I'm like, what? He said, this fake milk is CHUN MA,

30:28.700 --> 30:33.900
this is what CHUN MA means, this is fake, and he says, if you want to know how it relates to bodhichitta,

30:33.900 --> 30:35.900
you get me some real milk right now,

30:37.820 --> 30:39.420
then I'm like, okay,

30:39.420 --> 30:44.620
and I hassled the waitress and she bought some real milk, and okay, he said, this is CHUN MA

30:45.020 --> 30:50.460
MA YIN PA, this is non-fake milk, unfake milk, this is real milk, okay, so

30:51.580 --> 30:54.220
SEMS RGYAS CHUN MA MA YIN PA means the real thing, not like

30:56.460 --> 31:01.020
sugar cane, not like sugar cane, okay, you get it for real, but

31:02.540 --> 31:04.380
it's not clear to me

31:04.380 --> 31:06.620
from the lower middle way school if you

31:07.580 --> 31:10.220
have that experience with countless beings, I don't think so.

31:11.020 --> 31:15.340
So bodhisattva Arya,

31:16.380 --> 31:18.380
I don't know what you want to call it, the

31:19.420 --> 31:21.420
slot machine experience,

31:21.980 --> 31:28.700
okay, comes after the direct perception emptiness, okay, so now you have like six kinds of bodhichitta already, okay?

31:30.540 --> 31:34.140
Like the skin of the sugar cane, like the inside of the sugar cane,

31:34.780 --> 31:41.660
ultimate bodhichitta, normal bodhichitta, Arya bodhichitta, and then you have, what's one more, CHUN MA MA YIN PA,

31:42.300 --> 31:47.580
the real thing, when you switch from sugar cane to the real one, okay? It's not on your homework,

31:48.940 --> 31:51.500
it's just if you want to teach a deeper class, okay?

31:52.300 --> 31:54.300
All right,

31:54.300 --> 31:57.100
so the second question in your homework, when do you become a bodhisattva?

31:58.220 --> 31:59.740
When you reach that

31:59.820 --> 32:06.940
experience that you want to save all living beings, then you're a bodhisattva, so the state of mind makes you a bodhisattva, okay?

32:08.620 --> 32:11.820
Tibetan is CHANG CHU SEMS PA, okay? What does SAD PA mean?

32:13.820 --> 32:15.820
Warrior, okay? SAD PA means warrior.

32:16.620 --> 32:18.460
SEMS PA,

32:18.460 --> 32:21.340
spelled D-P-A in a possibly right word, not P-A,

32:21.980 --> 32:23.740
means

32:23.740 --> 32:28.380
you're a warrior, okay? So it's called a Buddha, Buddha warrior? You're not a Buddha yet,

32:28.940 --> 32:32.140
but bodhisattva means a Buddha warrior, okay?

32:35.340 --> 32:40.140
Question number three on your homework, has every bodhisattva seen emptiness directly?

32:41.580 --> 32:47.500
No, okay, could be on the first two paths of the Mahayana track, and they didn't see

32:49.100 --> 32:52.060
bodhisattva, bodhichitta, emptiness directly, okay?

32:53.020 --> 32:54.220
Okay,

32:54.220 --> 32:57.020
but if you do get bodhichitta, CHUN MA MA YIN PA,

32:57.980 --> 32:59.500
the real one,

32:59.500 --> 33:01.020
you entered

33:01.020 --> 33:04.060
TSOGS LAM for Mahayana, you entered the first path.

33:05.020 --> 33:07.020
In the Heart Sutra?

33:09.900 --> 33:15.100
Yeah, GATE GATE, it's the first GATE, you entered the first path, you saw,

33:15.980 --> 33:19.020
you have that experience, you're a bodhisattva, okay? GATE GATE.

33:19.660 --> 33:22.300
Okay, first GATE, right? What's the second GATE?

33:23.660 --> 33:25.580
Yeah, path of preparation,

33:25.660 --> 33:27.500
para gate,

33:27.500 --> 33:29.500
path of seen, para sang gate,

33:30.300 --> 33:36.860
path of habituation, and then bodhisattva, enlightenment. Pass it normally, okay good.

33:40.220 --> 33:43.260
So then I have a list of

33:44.700 --> 33:46.540
benefits of

33:46.540 --> 33:50.460
getting to bodhichitta that comes from your reading, okay? There's nine

33:51.420 --> 33:55.820
benefits in your reading, you only have to get six of them on the homework, so it's

33:57.100 --> 33:59.100
ridiculously easy, okay?

33:59.980 --> 34:05.900
So here we go, okay, you can put any one that you like, but you have to do six, then I'm going to give you

34:07.740 --> 34:09.740
22 more for fun,

34:10.860 --> 34:14.860
okay? Because it's a short homework, okay? We'll do 22 more from

34:16.780 --> 34:18.780
Maitreya, okay, all right.

34:21.420 --> 34:25.740
DGE BA RNAM KHYEN GYI ... by the way, the homework here has a lot of mistakes in the Tibetan,

34:26.620 --> 34:33.420
so we got to fix it sometime, okay? The homework master has a lot of ... this, particularly this last question.

34:33.900 --> 34:35.900
Okay, DGE BA RNAM KHYEN GYI RGYU,

34:38.540 --> 34:40.540
every good thing you ever do

34:41.260 --> 34:45.580
becomes a direct cause for buddhahood, okay? It cannot go to other places, okay?

34:46.380 --> 34:48.380
You don't get yochaos or

34:49.340 --> 34:52.300
donuts or ... okay, I guess you might get some,

34:53.340 --> 34:56.540
but they're all aimed at buddhahood. All the good deeds you do,

34:57.580 --> 34:59.340
go into the bank

34:59.340 --> 35:01.340
to create your buddhahood, okay? Once you have

35:02.380 --> 35:04.380
bodhichitta, okay?

35:05.180 --> 35:07.900
Because of that experience you had, okay? You can't ...

35:09.100 --> 35:11.900
unless you're having a really bad day, like you're throwing up on DGE,

35:12.860 --> 35:14.700
you can't have ...

35:14.700 --> 35:21.500
you can't forget what you're trying to do, right? You can't, you can never forget, so it's ...

35:22.540 --> 35:25.260
everything has the intention of becoming a buddhahood, okay?

35:26.140 --> 35:28.140
So you can't do a good deed

35:29.020 --> 35:31.020
as a bodhisattva

35:31.020 --> 35:35.660
without it becoming a cause for enlightenment directly, okay? You have to say directly, why?

35:38.060 --> 35:41.260
I mean, blowing your nose can be an indirect cause of enlightenment, right?

35:41.500 --> 35:44.540
Okay, we have to say direct cause, all right.

35:47.500 --> 35:49.500
Number two,

35:57.500 --> 35:59.500
what's the mean word?

35:59.820 --> 36:01.820
Yeah, to be worthy, okay?

36:02.780 --> 36:04.780
Of the prostration

36:04.780 --> 36:09.580
of every being on this planet, okay? If you reached ... if you have bodhichitta in your mind,

36:10.540 --> 36:12.540
if you want to

36:15.340 --> 36:17.900
save all beings, if that's your life's intention,

36:19.020 --> 36:22.140
then actually every time anyone meets you they should

36:22.780 --> 36:26.380
bow down to you, okay? Now they don't know who you are usually,

36:27.020 --> 36:28.700
so

36:28.700 --> 36:30.700
don't get worried if they don't bow down to you.

36:33.740 --> 36:37.100
Also, I'd say something about bodhisattvas, they don't advertise

36:38.060 --> 36:42.700
that they are bodhisattvas, they don't advertise that they're ayas, they don't put a tattoo here

36:43.500 --> 36:45.500
that says bow down to me,

36:45.500 --> 36:47.500
you know?

36:47.900 --> 36:49.660
They keep it

36:49.660 --> 36:51.660
a little bit quiet, that's a tradition.

36:52.300 --> 36:55.260
Nobody wrote that down, it's just a tradition. When you

36:56.220 --> 36:59.660
have that experience of emptiness, and when you have that experience of

37:00.700 --> 37:02.700
seeing all beings and wanting to help them,

37:02.700 --> 37:09.420
you don't advertise it, you don't go running to your friends and say, oh,

37:10.220 --> 37:12.700
I just saw emptiness there. There's something about it,

37:13.420 --> 37:15.420
and I think what it is is

37:17.660 --> 37:20.460
when we study anger tomorrow morning, hopefully,

37:23.180 --> 37:27.980
we'll be talking about the yul of anger, who are you angry at, okay?

37:28.780 --> 37:32.060
And that determines what's the karma of the anger,

37:32.860 --> 37:34.860
so if you're angry at a bodhisattva

37:35.740 --> 37:41.980
or you're angry at an Arya, the karma is extraordinary, you know? You could die from that, you see what I mean?

37:45.580 --> 37:48.700
So I think bodhisattvas and Aryas, they don't advertise much

37:49.580 --> 37:51.580
because they don't want people

37:52.060 --> 37:54.860
to know who they are, so they make heavier karma, you see what I mean?

37:55.740 --> 37:57.740
So it's kind of an unspoken

37:58.840 --> 38:02.300
tradition for Aryas and bodhisattvas, they don't advertise it.

38:02.940 --> 38:05.180
Because those people are not going to believe them anyway,

38:06.060 --> 38:09.020
and then they will do some bad thing and they will have terrible,

38:09.980 --> 38:16.060
very, very serious results, okay? From doing small bad things to the Arya or the bodhisattva, so

38:16.940 --> 38:18.940
I think that's why the tradition

38:19.660 --> 38:22.220
of not talking much about it, okay?

38:26.460 --> 38:29.420
Anyway, there's no way another person who can can confirm

38:29.980 --> 38:34.620
that you are Arya or bodhisattva, right? They can't read your mind, if they can read your mind, they know,

38:35.900 --> 38:37.420
but

38:37.420 --> 38:39.660
you could tell them you're a bodhisattva, but they can't

38:40.460 --> 38:45.420
confirm it, right? So in Buddhism, especially in the second school,

38:48.780 --> 38:51.980
logic school, we don't ask people to

38:52.940 --> 38:54.460
make a jump

38:54.460 --> 39:00.060
of faith that they cannot figure out with their mind, it's against Buddhist policy,

39:00.860 --> 39:03.100
you see? If they don't have the equipment

39:04.300 --> 39:06.300
to confirm that you're a bodhisattva and Arya,

39:07.020 --> 39:09.180
then it's a bad deed

39:09.180 --> 39:10.780
to tell them you are,

39:10.780 --> 39:15.100
and they can't check, they can't confirm, you see? So Buddhist logic is very beautiful,

39:16.060 --> 39:19.180
and if you fight with your wife, it's good to know Buddhist logic.

39:20.940 --> 39:22.700
You never use

39:22.700 --> 39:26.700
a statement that the other person doesn't already accept, it's not legal

39:27.500 --> 39:31.820
in Buddhist logic, so if you've never been to the restaurant in Bui,

39:33.020 --> 39:35.180
and I say,

39:35.180 --> 39:42.060
it's a good restaurant because you know you've been there, then you have to say, no, I haven't been there, see, for that person

39:42.060 --> 39:44.060
it's not a good reason, you see?

39:44.300 --> 39:47.340
So if you give someone a reason which is not good for them,

39:48.300 --> 39:52.940
in Buddhist logic, it's not logic, it's just wrong, and it's your fault.

39:54.060 --> 39:56.380
Interesting, you see? There's no truth

39:57.340 --> 39:59.340
outside, the truth is

39:59.820 --> 40:01.900
what does the other person already understand?

40:03.020 --> 40:08.700
And then you can use logic, oh you forgot, we went there a year ago, it was good food, we should go again,

40:09.260 --> 40:13.180
that's good logic, okay? They can confirm it, okay?

40:13.900 --> 40:19.820
So with a bodhisattva and Arya, a normal person cannot confirm it, okay? So it's kind of not fair

40:20.780 --> 40:24.700
to tell them, look, I'm a bodhisattva, you should treat me like a bodhisattva, never yell at me,

40:25.580 --> 40:27.580
or you will go to the lowest hell, you know?

40:28.860 --> 40:31.340
So obviously that could be abused also, okay?

40:33.660 --> 40:39.980
Say nyerang silki nunpa, and here the homework key has an error, okay?

40:40.220 --> 40:45.260
Silki nunpa, Rinpoche taught me a nice

40:46.060 --> 40:48.060
example, I think I told you before,

40:48.300 --> 40:51.580
we were watching TV, and of course, I'm not...

40:52.140 --> 40:55.660
Geshe-la and me weren't allowed to watch the TV, we have to sneak into his room,

40:56.700 --> 40:59.260
and he was watching a news show,

41:00.380 --> 41:03.420
and they had the Queen of England in a row of women,

41:04.620 --> 41:08.060
and Rinpoche said, can you guess which one is the Queen?

41:08.940 --> 41:12.620
And it's like five old ladies, you know, but one of them has this,

41:16.060 --> 41:20.940
and he said, that's a silki nunpa that I've been trying to teach you in the Abhisa Mankar, that,

41:21.660 --> 41:26.620
she outshines them, she outshines them, you don't have to know which one is the Queen, you can tell,

41:27.500 --> 41:30.620
she has some kind of a, what do you call, glamour, in old Irish

41:31.740 --> 41:33.740
sense, she has some,

41:34.220 --> 41:36.140
she has some

41:36.140 --> 41:40.220
glow about her, that's called silki nunpa, so the next quality,

41:41.740 --> 41:45.020
which is the third one, is that once you get bodhichitta,

41:45.820 --> 41:50.300
you outshine those other Buddhist practitioners, maybe they saw emptiness,

41:51.260 --> 41:53.260
and maybe they even reached arhat,

41:54.460 --> 41:57.980
but they don't have this wish to help all living beings, okay? So you

41:58.620 --> 42:00.620
outshine them, if they put you up

42:01.100 --> 42:03.100
in the TV next to them, you will

42:03.660 --> 42:05.660
you will look more

42:05.820 --> 42:07.980
cool, something, okay, silki nunpa, all right?

42:14.300 --> 42:19.820
The next homework answer has two mistakes in the Tibetan, in one line, so we got to fix that, okay,

42:20.700 --> 42:22.700
gyewa chung se tek chen gyu che,

42:23.500 --> 42:25.500
it means

42:25.500 --> 42:27.500
every little thing you do

42:27.500 --> 42:31.340
becomes Mahayana, everything you do becomes Mahayana, you drink some tea,

42:32.300 --> 42:39.420
you know, you wash dishes, you vacuum the floor in the temple,

42:42.780 --> 42:47.180
it becomes Mahayana, it becomes bodhisattva's activity, okay, so everything you do

42:48.700 --> 42:51.420
becomes Mahayana, okay, you are Mahayana,

42:52.300 --> 42:54.300
you are the Mahayana, okay, got it?

42:55.340 --> 42:57.340
What number was that?

42:57.580 --> 42:59.580
Yeah, good,

42:59.900 --> 43:04.940
even bad deeds, now that's a hard question, I would say Mahayana bad deed,

43:06.220 --> 43:08.220
more bad karma,

43:09.020 --> 43:11.020
I got out of that one, okay,

43:11.980 --> 43:13.340
next homework

43:13.340 --> 43:15.340
answer is mistaken,

43:15.660 --> 43:17.100
say,

43:17.100 --> 43:23.260
everything you do becomes the activity of bodhisattva, okay, and it's similar to the last one, but these aren't very,

43:24.220 --> 43:27.500
they're not clearly very different from each other, okay, everything you do

43:28.460 --> 43:33.740
becomes the bodhisattva's way of life, okay, the last one was

43:36.220 --> 43:39.180
everything you do becomes Mahayana, but it's the same thing really, okay,

43:40.300 --> 43:46.380
but it's kind of cool, yeah, here he says, Stanley, he says the good deeds you do become the activity of bodhisattva,

43:48.620 --> 43:54.860
oh, and the last one said good deeds too, okay, giwa, all right, that's number

43:54.860 --> 43:56.860
five,

43:56.940 --> 43:58.620
five,

43:58.620 --> 44:04.540
these are coming from Pabongka Rinpoche's commentary, okay, and you can read it in the reading number seven, okay,

44:05.100 --> 44:09.980
sangye nang gi se su gong, the Tibetan is misspelled again in the homework yi,

44:11.420 --> 44:13.820
I like this one, this is gyal se,

44:15.100 --> 44:18.940
so venerable gyal se's name is gyal se, it means gyal we se,

44:20.060 --> 44:22.060
and it means

44:23.020 --> 44:27.740
son or daughter of the victors, son or daughter of the victors, okay,

44:30.060 --> 44:33.020
when I wrote this translation 27 years ago,

44:33.900 --> 44:35.900
they didn't say he or she,

44:36.540 --> 44:39.340
they just said he in English, in American English,

44:40.060 --> 44:44.940
you know, every person who wants to become a bodhisattva, he should do this, and then

44:45.660 --> 44:49.100
in the last 27 years they made it more equal,

44:49.900 --> 44:52.300
and they say he or she, or you can say they,

44:53.820 --> 44:58.300
so you're going to see that sometimes in the reading, and I'm sorry for it, I just didn't have time to fix them all, okay,

44:59.020 --> 45:00.060
okay,

45:00.060 --> 45:01.660
it means

45:01.660 --> 45:07.980
all the buddhas consider you their son or their daughter, okay, and that's kind of cool,

45:08.860 --> 45:14.540
dan ni sang gyur rik su gye, sangye se su dag gyur to, dan ni dag gyu chi ni kyan rik dang tungpe le tsam te, kyi mi tungpe rik de la,

45:15.020 --> 45:18.540
nyopar ming gyur de dag ja, this is the short

45:19.900 --> 45:24.780
bodhisattva vow, you can take bodhisattva vows in one minute if the lama knows the verse, okay,

45:25.740 --> 45:29.020
dan ni sang gyur rik su gye, now today I have joined the family of the buddhas,

45:29.660 --> 45:32.780
sangye se su dag gyur to, now I became a son or daughter of the

45:33.420 --> 45:34.780
buddhas,

45:34.780 --> 45:39.420
dan ni dag gyu chi ni kyan, now no matter what, rik dang tungpe le tsam te, I will act

45:40.220 --> 45:42.220
to keep my family happy,

45:42.380 --> 45:48.060
dan ni sung gyur rik de la, this faultless lineage, I will never embarrass my parents,

45:49.180 --> 45:51.180
okay, that's the one of the,

45:52.140 --> 45:54.620
if you have to take bodhisattva vows in the airport

45:55.900 --> 45:57.900
with some lama who's changing planes,

45:58.540 --> 46:00.300
you can use that one,

46:00.300 --> 46:01.420
okay,

46:01.420 --> 46:05.500
remember our lama used to use it sometimes, it means I won't mess up,

46:06.220 --> 46:09.980
I won't make my parents unhappy, I will keep these bodhisattva vows, okay,

46:10.780 --> 46:14.140
so you become a new family, you join a new family,

46:14.940 --> 46:20.620
you're the buddha family, and they take care of you special, I know they're supposed to be equal to everybody, but they're not,

46:22.380 --> 46:24.700
okay, they take care of you special, okay,

46:27.180 --> 46:29.260
you will meet them frequently, okay,

46:31.340 --> 46:33.340
number one,

46:33.660 --> 46:36.060
seven, chen chu senpa nang gi,

46:36.940 --> 46:38.940
pun du gong,

46:41.260 --> 46:42.460
yeah,

46:42.460 --> 46:47.260
and all the other bodhisattvas in the universe will think of you as their brother or their sister, okay,

46:47.820 --> 46:49.820
so the last one was you got new parents,

46:51.100 --> 46:53.820
and this one you got new brothers and sisters, okay,

46:54.700 --> 46:59.020
so all the bodhisattvas introduce you, and they say, oh this is my sister Jenny Wong,

47:00.060 --> 47:01.340
this is my

47:01.340 --> 47:03.340
bodhisattva sister Jenny Wong,

47:04.300 --> 47:07.340
so gyal se is lucky she got this name, nun's name,

47:09.340 --> 47:11.740
daughter of the buddhas, princess of the buddhas,

47:12.540 --> 47:15.900
sometimes se can mean daughter, sometimes se mo,

47:16.700 --> 47:19.420
sometimes it can mean princess, but we know which one she is,

47:21.260 --> 47:28.380
she's the princess of the buddhas, okay, okay, so that last one was all the bodhisattvas consider you their brother or their sister, okay,

47:29.100 --> 47:34.460
thek chen la shuk, say thek chen la shuk,

47:35.500 --> 47:38.940
you enter Mahayana, okay, so becoming a bodhisattva,

47:40.140 --> 47:43.020
getting real bodhichitta, chu ma ma yin, but not fake one,

47:44.620 --> 47:46.220
and

47:46.220 --> 47:51.660
entering Mahayana are the same, same moment, in the same moment, you can now you can say I'm in the Mahayana,

47:52.140 --> 47:54.140
I'm in the greater path, okay,

47:59.180 --> 48:01.420
why greater path? Because yana

48:03.260 --> 48:05.260
can also mean what?

48:06.380 --> 48:12.540
I like to call it vehicle capacity, like can your car carry 12 people or will it break?

48:13.420 --> 48:18.460
You see, so Mahayana means big capacity, okay, big, strong enough to carry

48:19.180 --> 48:21.180
lots of people, how many people?

48:21.980 --> 48:25.020
Countless, okay, countless, billions and billions, okay,

48:26.300 --> 48:28.300
what number?

48:29.340 --> 48:30.620
Nine,

48:30.620 --> 48:32.620
last one, right, on this list,

48:33.340 --> 48:35.340
say tse chig la

48:35.660 --> 48:37.660
sangye,

48:37.660 --> 48:42.220
you have the capacity to become a buddha in one lifetime, if you practice tantra,

48:43.500 --> 48:48.620
vajrayana, then because you're a bodhisattva you can reach buddhahood in one lifetime, okay,

48:49.820 --> 48:51.660
ku ma,

48:51.660 --> 48:53.580
okay,

48:53.580 --> 48:55.580
that's the whole homework,

48:55.980 --> 49:02.140
I don't feel too well, but I'd like to go another half hour, okay, and I'd like to read you

49:04.700 --> 49:06.700
the 22 from Maitreya,

49:07.100 --> 49:10.380
which are very cool, okay, so I'm making a new rule

49:11.020 --> 49:13.260
on this homework, you're going to get 31,

49:14.140 --> 49:16.140
and you only have to write six,

49:16.380 --> 49:19.660
if you can't remember six you have a problem, okay, you ready?

49:20.540 --> 49:26.780
Yen ten kan, yen ten di den chog rupay, de yang sasar,

49:28.540 --> 49:31.500
come on, come on, de yang sasar dangwa me, you want to do it?

49:33.660 --> 49:38.800
Just the shloka chik, he's going to give you the monastery financing.

49:49.660 --> 50:07.820
De yang sasar dangwa me, de da rin chen chung ne tso, do je rin me shen nge dang, hi shen nu pung nge maluk,

50:07.820 --> 50:14.620
gya po zo da lam po che, shon pa kyu me choo dang ni, drang nge choo po tri nam kyi, nam pa nge choo tang nge so.

50:15.340 --> 50:17.340
Thank you.

50:18.220 --> 50:20.220
These are the 22 kinds.

50:26.540 --> 50:30.460
And I have the Sanskrit for you just for fun, okay, and I think

50:31.260 --> 50:33.260
it's good to know a little bit of Sanskrit,

50:34.300 --> 50:38.220
it's a good seed in your mind, they say after you become Buddha you speak Sanskrit, okay,

50:39.260 --> 50:41.580
so let's put some seeds for the Sanskrit, okay,

50:45.260 --> 50:47.260
here we go,

50:48.300 --> 50:49.740
I

50:49.740 --> 50:51.740
have two versions of this,

50:53.100 --> 50:56.860
one is by Tsongkhapa, and I figure you'd rather have that, it's a little bit longer,

50:58.860 --> 51:04.700
but maybe we'll finish tomorrow if we have to, okay, so the first one, de yang sa, say sa,

51:05.820 --> 51:09.740
sa means the foundation of the earth, sashi, right, in the sushi part,

51:09.740 --> 51:11.740
sashi,

51:12.460 --> 51:18.700
sushi is sashi, it means the the ground, bumi, bumi in Sanskrit, okay, bu,

51:19.580 --> 51:23.420
it can mean bu in Sanskrit, okay, and it means the the ground,

51:24.060 --> 51:26.060
so if you get to bodhichitta

51:27.740 --> 51:30.780
you get the foundation, I was in, where was I?

51:33.820 --> 51:35.820
I don't remember, Zhengzhou maybe,

51:36.060 --> 51:40.540
but for two years they're building a skyscraper next to the hotel,

51:41.740 --> 51:43.180
and they're

51:43.180 --> 51:47.660
working on the foundation, and it's amazing to watch, they have to dig

51:48.460 --> 51:50.380
very very deep,

51:50.380 --> 51:54.780
and they have to put the cement very very deep, and it took like two years

51:55.660 --> 52:02.860
to finish the foundation, then the rest is easy, right, but if the foundation of a high building is not strong,

52:03.820 --> 52:07.260
the high building will fall down, okay, so they spend a lot of time on the

52:08.200 --> 52:13.180
foundation, so you can say foundation, okay, it's a foundation, for what?

52:14.700 --> 52:21.900
You can build all the other Buddhahood things on it, okay, we call 37 chang chok so dun, 37 qualities of a Buddha,

52:22.620 --> 52:25.580
you can build them on this great foundation, you can build

52:26.220 --> 52:31.980
a 37 story building on this foundation, okay, so you have the correct foundation,

52:32.860 --> 52:35.340
to go higher, okay, you can start doing

52:37.340 --> 52:43.180
Buddha skyscrapers, okay, but if you don't have bodhichitta you cannot, okay, so these are

52:44.380 --> 52:47.180
allow you to go higher and higher, okay, so the first

52:48.300 --> 52:52.860
the first example of the 22 of Maitreya is boo, boo, boo,

52:54.300 --> 52:57.980
and it means the foundation, okay, the foundation,

52:58.780 --> 53:03.500
and you can build lots of beautiful things on top of it, okay, you can really build

53:04.140 --> 53:06.460
a Buddha's body and mind on top of it, okay,

53:07.580 --> 53:09.580
all right, second one,

53:11.260 --> 53:13.260
say hema,

53:13.260 --> 53:18.700
hema means gold in Sanskrit, hema, okay, suvarna is another word, but hema

53:19.660 --> 53:21.660
means gold,

53:21.660 --> 53:24.380
gold is what we call a noble metal, what's it mean?

53:24.380 --> 53:30.620
It won't rust, it won't oxidize, if you leave it out

53:31.740 --> 53:34.380
in the stream, or you leave it out in the rain

53:35.340 --> 53:37.900
for a thousand years, it will still be as bright.

53:39.420 --> 53:45.420
We were in Japan, were you with me? I don't remember. Oh, we got invited to this

53:47.340 --> 53:50.460
private jewelry collector, last month he was in Forbes,

53:50.540 --> 53:53.740
and you know, right, you sent it to me,

53:56.140 --> 53:59.420
Mr. Arigawa in Tokyo, he has

54:01.260 --> 54:03.260
he has like 2,000

54:03.580 --> 54:06.940
ancient pieces of jewelry, you know, he has these crowns

54:07.660 --> 54:10.940
of the kings of Europe, they have 2,000 diamonds in them,

54:11.660 --> 54:16.620
he has a necklace of Queen Elizabeth, the diamonds are this big, he put it on a wreath,

54:17.820 --> 54:19.820
and we took a picture and

54:21.100 --> 54:23.100
he just likes the diamond cutter book,

54:23.740 --> 54:27.580
and he says, we are brothers, and he, so he spent four hours with us, and he

54:28.300 --> 54:31.340
showed us all these things, and then on me he said, come here,

54:32.220 --> 54:34.220
and he gave me a

54:34.380 --> 54:36.380
crown,

54:37.100 --> 54:42.700
Roman crown, 2,000 years old, and it has laurel leaves, special leaves,

54:43.580 --> 54:45.180
all gold,

54:45.180 --> 54:49.100
and very very thin, they feel like, if you touch them they go like this, you know,

54:49.980 --> 54:51.500
and

54:51.500 --> 54:54.300
he put it on my head, and I told Scott, take a photo quick,

54:55.180 --> 54:56.940
and then

54:56.940 --> 55:02.780
it started to fall off, and I didn't know what to do, and I grabbed it, and one of the leaves fell off, and I'm like,

55:04.060 --> 55:07.100
you know, I said, how many million dollars do I owe you, you know,

55:07.820 --> 55:10.460
and he said, don't worry, I can fix it, you know, but

55:11.340 --> 55:13.340
they didn't polish the gold

55:13.340 --> 55:16.780
for 2,000 years, because it doesn't rust, gold doesn't rust, okay,

55:17.500 --> 55:19.900
and Bodhisattva's state of mind,

55:20.780 --> 55:22.780
after that first day,

55:23.820 --> 55:28.460
it will never change, it won't get rusty or dirty or old, okay,

55:32.200 --> 55:39.020
44 years later, it's still as strong, it doesn't get less, okay, it just gets strong, okay,

55:39.580 --> 55:41.340
like gold, okay,

55:41.340 --> 55:44.220
doesn't ever change, the motivation is still 100% the same,

55:45.180 --> 55:47.180
okay,

55:47.260 --> 55:49.260
all right,

55:50.140 --> 55:52.060
third one,

55:52.060 --> 55:54.060
what's the Sanskrit for moon?

55:55.320 --> 55:58.780
Chandra, okay, Chandra means moon,

56:01.660 --> 56:03.660
incense comes from that, the c-e-n,

56:04.700 --> 56:07.020
or incandescent comes from that, okay,

56:08.220 --> 56:10.380
and it means the moon, okay, the shining one,

56:11.580 --> 56:13.580
and what it means is

56:14.380 --> 56:16.380
let me see here,

56:22.860 --> 56:24.860
yeah, so moonlight

56:25.580 --> 56:27.580
is supposed to be different from sunlight

56:28.380 --> 56:31.500
in Buddhism, and certain kinds of flowers,

56:32.540 --> 56:34.540
like we have one here, it's called,

56:35.100 --> 56:37.100
what is that?

56:37.500 --> 56:39.500
Datura, yeah,

56:39.740 --> 56:42.620
it's a white flower, it only opens in moonlight,

56:43.580 --> 56:46.460
you can see it here, it's also called loco weed,

56:47.420 --> 56:49.340
loco means crazy,

56:49.340 --> 56:53.020
and if you eat it, you have a hallucination, so some

56:53.900 --> 56:55.900
people eat it on purpose, some people die,

56:56.460 --> 56:58.460
so don't do it, okay,

56:58.940 --> 57:06.540
but sometimes cattle will eat it and they'll go, they will die, so it's a beautiful white flower, the flower doesn't hurt you,

57:07.580 --> 57:11.500
I tried to take one from Diamond Mountain to my house, it wouldn't grow, I don't know why,

57:12.620 --> 57:14.620
but anyway,

57:16.060 --> 57:17.580
here's Tsongkapa,

57:17.580 --> 57:19.980
tsongpa tsongpa hlakpe hlakpe tsongpa dun derpa ni,

57:20.460 --> 57:21.980
tawa tsepa,

57:21.980 --> 57:24.140
tawa tsepa means rising moon,

57:25.260 --> 57:26.460
what do you call it?

57:26.460 --> 57:27.900
Waxing,

57:27.900 --> 57:29.900
waxing moon,

57:30.780 --> 57:32.780
the waxing moon in

57:33.580 --> 57:35.580
in Diamond Mountain ends tonight,

57:36.620 --> 57:39.020
it's been growing for 14 days,

57:39.980 --> 57:42.940
and it stops getting bigger tonight, tomorrow will be full moon,

57:43.980 --> 57:47.500
and then it starts to shrink, okay, so this moon means

57:48.520 --> 57:50.520
waxing moon,

57:50.940 --> 57:52.940
gyeway chu dak ni,

57:52.940 --> 57:54.940
tada kong ne kong du pangway gyup nyi kyi te,

57:55.340 --> 57:57.100
then you're good,

57:57.100 --> 57:59.420
you're good deeds, you're good qualities,

58:00.060 --> 58:02.060
just keep getting more and more sweet,

58:02.860 --> 58:06.940
more and more big, okay, and that's like the moon, growing moon,

58:07.900 --> 58:09.900
okay,

58:10.220 --> 58:12.780
and that's the third one, so if you have bodhichitta,

58:14.300 --> 58:16.860
then I don't know, even your physical qualities, even your

58:17.900 --> 58:20.220
mental capacity, it grows every day,

58:21.020 --> 58:25.020
and your good deeds grow every day, you do more and more cool things,

58:25.900 --> 58:27.020
okay,

58:27.020 --> 58:29.020
like the moon, like the waxing moon,

58:30.140 --> 58:31.340
okay,

58:31.340 --> 58:33.340
fourth one is difficult,

58:33.580 --> 58:35.580
uh,

58:35.980 --> 58:37.980
let me get it right,

58:38.540 --> 58:40.540
say jvalana,

58:40.620 --> 58:47.820
jvalana, j-v-a-l-a-n-a, jvalana, it means a fire, agon?

58:48.940 --> 58:50.700
agon?

58:50.700 --> 58:52.460
agonya,

58:52.460 --> 58:55.500
agonya, okay, that by the way comes from Agni,

58:56.940 --> 58:59.180
Sanskrit, so anyway, uh,

59:00.220 --> 59:02.220
fire, so what's the fire?

59:03.020 --> 59:05.020
uh,

59:05.260 --> 59:07.260
it burns

59:09.180 --> 59:12.700
the wrong ideas about emptiness, okay, it helps you burn

59:13.740 --> 59:19.020
the wrong ideas about emptiness, and you know, whose school is abhisamankara?

59:21.500 --> 59:23.980
Lower middle way, so they say there's kind of

59:24.860 --> 59:26.860
three flavors of emptiness, right?

59:27.500 --> 59:30.380
Three flavors of emptiness, I don't think I gave those to you

59:31.340 --> 59:33.340
in the seven,

59:33.820 --> 59:35.260
but uh,

59:35.260 --> 59:37.500
for example, you might say that

59:38.140 --> 59:40.300
someone in an abhidharma track,

59:41.420 --> 59:44.460
they will perceive emptiness as nothing is

59:45.880 --> 59:48.940
unchanging, nothing is unchanging, don't get upset

59:50.060 --> 59:53.020
if your husband fights with you because it won't last forever,

59:53.660 --> 59:56.220
that's a kind of a lower emptiness, okay?

59:56.940 --> 59:58.940
Does it help to burn your bad deeds?

59:59.900 --> 01:00:07.260
Yeah, you won't yell back, right, or you'll try to stick cum, it's a lower emptiness, it's not real emptiness, but it will burn

01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:13.020
your negative emotions, okay? Second one, we can say second school,

01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:18.040
emptiness, huh?

01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:21.980
Yeah, so the first one is called mi tape tongwa, by the way, I say, tape tongwa,

01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:26.140
empty of being unchanging, second one,

01:00:26.140 --> 01:00:28.140
okay?

01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:32.380
Yeah, I don't have control, okay, I don't have control, rang wang ki tongwa,

01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:34.940
okay, rang wang ki tongwa, I don't have

01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:40.540
control over this husband, I can negotiate, I can talk reasonably,

01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:43.340
I can

01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:48.540
blackmail, no dinner tonight, later on I could blackmail something more serious,

01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:55.020
but it might not work, okay? What might not work?

01:00:56.540 --> 01:01:00.620
Lower school definition, okay? Lower school definition

01:01:01.420 --> 01:01:04.620
might work, might not work, lower school emptiness, okay?

01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:07.580
And then the highest emptiness

01:01:08.700 --> 01:01:15.100
of this husband coming from my seeds, if I want him to be nice to me, the only thing I can do is

01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:20.780
be nice to my kids, stop yelling at my kids, then I will make sweet seeds,

01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:23.580
if I speak kindly to my kids,

01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:29.260
then I will plant seeds and my husband will speak kindly to me, does it work sometimes or all the time?

01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:35.260
It works all the time, sometimes it doesn't look like it's working because it takes time for a seed to open, okay?

01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:39.020
So don't lose faith in it just because it takes time to open, okay?

01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:44.780
Don't plant a watermelon seed and expect a watermelon the next day, doesn't happen, okay?

01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:48.060
All right, so it burns the three kinds of

01:01:49.260 --> 01:01:50.620
wrong ideas,

01:01:50.620 --> 01:01:52.620
that things are unchanging,

01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:55.100
that things are under my control,

01:01:55.980 --> 01:01:59.740
or that things don't come from my seeds, okay? Got it? That's the fire.

01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:05.420
If you have bodhichitta, it's easier to understand those things, okay? Much easier.

01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:10.700
Because everything you do is Mahayana Dharma, then you're making good karma constantly, okay?

01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:13.340
If a bodhisattva sits in the class

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:17.900
or a non-bodhisattva sits in the class, the bodhisattva will get much more good karma, okay?

01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:21.020
All right,

01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:26.000
number five is called nidhi, say nidhi.

01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:31.100
And we'll go another half hour, okay? I'm going to stop half an hour early, don't get upset.

01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:36.620
Nidhi means treasure, like,

01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:40.860
I don't know how you say,

01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:46.540
like gold mine, you can say gold mine.

01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:48.780
So nidhi means

01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:54.620
treasure in that sense. If you dig under the ground, you will find this big bunch of gold, okay?

01:02:56.380 --> 01:02:58.860
And that refers to the bodhisattva's

01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:02.200
capacity

01:03:02.620 --> 01:03:04.620
to do the first perfection.

01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:12.460
Yeah, they're giving, they're much more into giving, okay? They're much more enjoy giving and they

01:03:13.340 --> 01:03:16.140
they're never stingy, they just give, give, give, give, okay?

01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:18.860
They get something and they give it.

01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:22.380
I have a diamond dealer friend, he's a Jane,

01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:25.500
a very, very nice man,

01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:27.980
and he donates money every day to something.

01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:31.020
And I said, you know what?

01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:33.180
Don't you ever run out of money? He said, no,

01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:36.380
you got to keep it moving, man, you got to keep it moving.

01:03:37.020 --> 01:03:44.700
And he's not Buddhist, but he's got this understanding, you know, keep it moving. When you hold on to money, it stops making money,

01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:50.460
you know, and when you give it to other people, it keeps making money, okay? So bodhisattvas are like that.

01:03:51.580 --> 01:03:58.540
They keep giving and giving and giving, like a gold mine, okay? You can keep digging and there's more gold, okay?

01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:06.540
There's a little bit of self-interest there, who wants to explain it?

01:04:06.540 --> 01:04:16.060
Yeah, for a bodhisattva, giving away things is not so cool in one way because

01:04:17.340 --> 01:04:19.340
they clearly know they're going to get more.

01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:21.740
So it's almost selfish,

01:04:22.300 --> 01:04:25.740
you see? They keep giving students hundred dollars to answer questions.

01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:31.660
Okay?

01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:34.300
In the monastery, you don't answer the question, you get a rosary

01:04:35.260 --> 01:04:37.260
on the head, yunten can tell you.

01:04:38.540 --> 01:04:45.740
Okay, but so bodhisattva is kind of tricking everybody. Oh here, take my money. Oh, you're so nice to give me money.

01:04:46.060 --> 01:04:48.060
Yeah, I'm so nice.

01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:52.140
But actually, I'm making more money, okay?

01:04:53.340 --> 01:04:59.100
All right? Nidhi, the giving of a bodhisattva is like an endless gold mine, okay?

01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:03.260
Number six, out of

01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:06.860
twenty-two. By the way, maybe I'll try to find it for you tomorrow,

01:05:07.740 --> 01:05:10.380
a very cool Chinese businessman, Dr. Wu,

01:05:11.100 --> 01:05:15.100
who paid for your Tsongkhapa cafeteria, and you should thank him if you ever meet him,

01:05:16.220 --> 01:05:18.780
and he paid for the roads that are not quite finished yet,

01:05:20.220 --> 01:05:22.220
and

01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:28.060
he asked me one day to come to his apartment in Beijing and teach him this twenty-two,

01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:32.780
and we did, I think, were you there, Xiaoping? Or you both were there, I don't remember.

01:05:33.660 --> 01:05:35.260
Uh,

01:05:35.260 --> 01:05:37.260
and he had a tanka

01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:39.260
of the twenty-two,

01:05:39.580 --> 01:05:45.820
and I think I made a copy of it. I'll show you, okay? It's cool to try to figure out where's the twenty-two

01:05:46.700 --> 01:05:48.700
in the tanka. I think so.

01:05:49.580 --> 01:05:51.580
Okay,

01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:56.620
six is your second perfection gets cranked up.

01:05:57.580 --> 01:06:04.140
Huh? Yeah, morality, ethical way of life. In America, when you say morality,

01:06:05.660 --> 01:06:08.300
it seems a little bit too Christian, like very

01:06:09.420 --> 01:06:11.900
tough Christians, you know, if you don't follow their

01:06:13.180 --> 01:06:18.940
ideas about morality, you're a bad person, so I try to call it ethical life, you know, ethical life, ethics,

01:06:19.820 --> 01:06:22.140
same meaning, same meaning, but anyway,

01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:24.860
uh,

01:06:24.860 --> 01:06:29.660
your, your ethical life, your morality gets very, very strong.

01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:33.020
Bodhisattvas are more,

01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:35.900
they follow the Hinayana

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:39.100
morality better than the Hinayana.

01:06:40.140 --> 01:06:44.060
That's a big advertisement that was made by the, written by the bodhisattvas,

01:06:45.260 --> 01:06:47.340
okay? Like,

01:06:47.340 --> 01:06:50.140
we don't kill better than those Hinayanas don't kill,

01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:55.660
and we don't steal better than those Hinayana don't steal, because we understand

01:06:57.260 --> 01:07:04.620
the point of it, we really understand, and we want to become buddhas as fast as we can, so we don't hurt people, okay? Got it?

01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:11.600
That's compared to a ratnakara, you got it word? Ratnakara.

01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:15.980
Not exactly.

01:07:20.140 --> 01:07:22.140
Uh,

01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:24.460
it's one of the five dhyani buddhas, right? What color?

01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:29.420
Yellow. It means source of jewels, right? Akhara means source,

01:07:30.140 --> 01:07:32.140
ratna means jewels, okay?

01:07:32.220 --> 01:07:33.260
So,

01:07:33.260 --> 01:07:36.780
ratnakara means you are like a source of jewels, okay?

01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:39.500
You are like a source of jewels,

01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:42.380
uh, because you understand

01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:44.700
that keeping your morality

01:07:44.940 --> 01:07:46.940
is like where you get

01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:51.260
all the precious things from that, okay? And just normal morality, okay?

01:07:53.100 --> 01:07:57.820
Also, it means bodhisattva morality, and also tantric morality, if you have it, okay?

01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:05.500
Number seven relates to the next

01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:08.940
perfection?

01:08:08.940 --> 01:08:09.980
No.

01:08:09.980 --> 01:08:11.180
Yeah.

01:08:11.180 --> 01:08:13.180
What's the next perfection?

01:08:13.180 --> 01:08:15.180
Giving, ethical life,

01:08:15.820 --> 01:08:17.820
patience, not getting angry, okay?

01:08:18.300 --> 01:08:20.460
And it's compared to arna, say arna.

01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:25.260
Arna means the ocean, it's an old word for the ocean, okay?

01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:30.240
Sagara is the more common word, but arna is an ancient word, okay? Arna.

01:08:31.260 --> 01:08:33.260
This is cool because, uh,

01:08:37.980 --> 01:08:39.980
if the same wind blows on a leg

01:08:40.940 --> 01:08:42.940
and it blows on an ocean,

01:08:43.260 --> 01:08:48.700
the leg will get choppy, but the ocean will stay glassy, okay?

01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:51.020
So bodhisattvas

01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:54.380
are so advanced, they don't get angry easily, okay?

01:08:55.180 --> 01:08:57.820
Even if this person wasn't coming from me,

01:08:59.660 --> 01:09:03.180
they're the person I'm trying to save, they're the person I'm trying to help,

01:09:04.060 --> 01:09:06.060
so I can't get angry at them.

01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:10.380
Parents don't really get angry at their children, they pretend to be angry,

01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:16.060
but as I said, it's difficult to find a parent who divorced their kids.

01:09:16.780 --> 01:09:18.780
They divorce each other,

01:09:19.580 --> 01:09:22.620
but nobody divorces their kids, very rare, okay?

01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:25.660
So, uh,

01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:30.300
arna, arna in Sanskrit means ocean, so bodhisattva's mind

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:33.660
is like an ocean, and a small wind

01:09:34.540 --> 01:09:37.260
cannot upset the bodhisattva's mind. They never get

01:09:38.060 --> 01:09:40.060
really angry, they get sort of angry,

01:09:41.180 --> 01:09:42.460
okay?

01:09:42.460 --> 01:09:45.020
But they never get totally angry, they can't,

01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:49.020
because these are my kids, these are the ones I saw in my

01:09:49.980 --> 01:09:54.460
vision, these are the ones I promised to keep, to take care of, okay? So they never get totally angry.

01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:57.900
They can get a little bit angry.

01:09:58.380 --> 01:10:00.380
Okay,

01:10:01.420 --> 01:10:06.620
number eight, right? Let's try to do half, okay? Let's say vajra,

01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:12.140
diamond, right? Vajra is the old word for diamond. I like it because vaj means

01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:15.660
power,

01:10:15.660 --> 01:10:17.660
and what English word comes from it?

01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:22.860
Vegetable, okay? So in ancient times, in India,

01:10:23.740 --> 01:10:27.100
vegetables were considered to have great power, more than meat or

01:10:27.980 --> 01:10:31.180
things like that, so a person who's a vegetarian is actually stronger.

01:10:32.860 --> 01:10:36.620
When I became, I'll tell you the story, okay? Maybe Geshe-la doesn't know it,

01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:38.700
okay?

01:10:38.700 --> 01:10:41.180
So one day, you know, I'm the cook for eight years,

01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:44.780
which is why people are helping me all the time,

01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:49.980
and I have to make momo, you know? Momo is meat,

01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:52.780
you cut meat and you put it inside a

01:10:54.300 --> 01:10:56.300
dough and you cook it, and then,

01:10:57.660 --> 01:11:02.060
so I have to cook it every day, but I don't like to eat it. I want to be a vegetarian,

01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:06.540
but everybody in the monastery is eating meat at that time, not now.

01:11:07.740 --> 01:11:09.740
And so I,

01:11:10.060 --> 01:11:14.300
one day I told my teacher, I don't feel so good, you know? I think I have to go to the doctor,

01:11:15.420 --> 01:11:19.340
and I drove to the doctor in, what's that place called? Framingdale.

01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:22.300
It's about

01:11:22.460 --> 01:11:24.620
half an hour from the monastery,

01:11:25.660 --> 01:11:27.660
Mongolian monastery, and

01:11:28.380 --> 01:11:30.700
I sat in the car outside the doctor's office

01:11:31.580 --> 01:11:33.740
for like 45 minutes, then I drove home,

01:11:34.700 --> 01:11:41.740
and I told my lama, you know, the doctor told me it's very serious and I have to stop eating meat,

01:11:42.940 --> 01:11:44.620
you know, and

01:11:44.620 --> 01:11:46.620
Tibetans really respect doctors.

01:11:47.580 --> 01:11:52.300
So my lama was like, oh, okay, you don't have to eat meat, you know? You still have to cook it,

01:11:54.140 --> 01:11:56.140
but you don't have to eat it.

01:11:56.140 --> 01:12:00.300
And then, you know, my family, my friends, they found out I wasn't eating meat, and they

01:12:01.260 --> 01:12:04.700
they said, oh, you're going to get sick, you, you will, what?

01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:08.460
You won't have enough protein, stuff like that, you will get sick,

01:12:09.260 --> 01:12:11.420
you'll get weak, you know, and

01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:15.100
that was

01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:18.140
34 years ago,

01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:23.820
and I'm still doing, I'm 66, still doing yoga with all you 30s and 40s,

01:12:24.940 --> 01:12:29.500
okay? I think I'm the strongest one left from my generation, except today.

01:12:30.460 --> 01:12:32.460
But

01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:36.700
all my friends who told me don't stop eating meat, they're all dead.

01:12:37.660 --> 01:12:39.660
They all had heart attacks,

01:12:39.820 --> 01:12:41.020
they all had

01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:44.860
cancer. I believe that eating meat creates those seeds.

01:12:46.300 --> 01:12:48.620
I think the bad karma creates cholesterol,

01:12:49.580 --> 01:12:52.060
and I think you're more likely to die.

01:12:53.500 --> 01:12:55.500
So I can honestly say

01:12:56.220 --> 01:13:00.220
about half of those friends are dead, who told me don't stop eating meat.

01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:02.300
Okay?

01:13:04.220 --> 01:13:06.220
What are we talking about? Oh, Vajra.

01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:10.060
Okay, there's a region why it means vegetable, okay?

01:13:10.860 --> 01:13:15.180
All right, so number eight relates to the perfection of, the next perfection.

01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:20.060
Joyful effort, so bodhisattva

01:13:20.860 --> 01:13:23.660
is much more capable of practicing

01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:25.660
fun

01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:30.620
than someone who's not a bodhisattva. Even if they're feeling sick, they can still make jokes and stuff.

01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:33.580
Okay, so

01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:38.380
I, you know, it's called effort, but really it means

01:13:39.340 --> 01:13:41.340
fun effort. You have fun

01:13:41.580 --> 01:13:44.380
doing Buddhism. It's fun for you, you know, and

01:13:45.580 --> 01:13:49.580
if someone says you want to see a movie or you want to go visit this sick person, you say, oh man,

01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:52.460
I want the high quality entertainment

01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:55.500
at the hospital.

01:13:55.500 --> 01:13:59.100
You see, so then you have fun doing things. People think you're crazy because

01:14:00.460 --> 01:14:04.380
maybe you're studying all the time or translating, and you're like, don't you want to have some fun?

01:14:04.460 --> 01:14:07.260
They say, no, I am having fun. You're not having fun.

01:14:08.300 --> 01:14:12.300
Okay, so that's Vajra. What it means is

01:14:13.740 --> 01:14:15.340
if you,

01:14:15.340 --> 01:14:17.020
oftentimes

01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:18.780
the word diamond

01:14:18.780 --> 01:14:21.740
in Tibetan or in Buddhist scripture is called mi che pa,

01:14:23.020 --> 01:14:24.940
cannot be split.

01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:27.420
The thing which cannot be split, so it means

01:14:28.700 --> 01:14:31.740
as long as you have bodhisattva mind,

01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:36.940
you can't be split from working hard for other people. You will never give up

01:14:38.380 --> 01:14:40.380
taking care of other people, okay?

01:14:41.340 --> 01:14:44.380
And so it's called unsplittable, and that's the meaning of Vajra.

01:14:48.140 --> 01:14:51.980
Number nine, we'll do two more. Okay, we'll do eleven.

01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:54.460
Uh,

01:14:54.460 --> 01:14:56.460
what do you guess is next?

01:14:57.740 --> 01:15:00.140
Yeah, I was hoping you would give it to me Stanley.

01:15:02.860 --> 01:15:04.860
Yeah, meditation. Okay, so

01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:07.500
the next one is called achala.

01:15:08.140 --> 01:15:09.500
Achala.

01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:14.860
Ah means not in Sanskrit. Ah at the beginning of a word means, ah, it means not, okay?

01:15:16.300 --> 01:15:17.660
And uh,

01:15:17.660 --> 01:15:19.660
like amita pa,

01:15:20.060 --> 01:15:21.500
amita pa,

01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:23.020
ah means not,

01:15:23.020 --> 01:15:25.260
mita means measure, pa means light,

01:15:26.140 --> 01:15:28.140
amita pa, not amitabha,

01:15:29.020 --> 01:15:31.020
okay? Amitabha, okay?

01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:33.500
So achala means not chala,

01:15:34.220 --> 01:15:35.660
and chala

01:15:35.660 --> 01:15:37.660
means to move,

01:15:37.740 --> 01:15:40.780
to move, okay? The word accelerator comes from that,

01:15:41.420 --> 01:15:50.300
alacrity comes from that I think, car comes from that, chariot comes from that, it means moving vehicle, okay?

01:15:51.660 --> 01:15:53.900
So what's an achala is a mountain,

01:15:55.020 --> 01:15:59.100
never moves, you can't just move a mountain if you don't like where it is.

01:16:00.460 --> 01:16:03.260
Difficult to move a mountain. So bodhisattva's

01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:07.980
meditation is very very high,

01:16:08.940 --> 01:16:11.100
much much higher, okay? If you're,

01:16:12.540 --> 01:16:17.020
if in the back of your mind you had the, we're going to call it the slot machine experience,

01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:19.820
it's kind of cool, right?

01:16:19.820 --> 01:16:22.780
If you had the slot machine experience, then uh,

01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:28.460
your meditation is completely different, okay? It's very very high, very deep, okay?

01:16:29.340 --> 01:16:32.540
Your focus is ten times deeper, a hundred times, a thousand times.

01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:35.340
Okay.

01:16:35.340 --> 01:16:40.460
mi kye pa, nothing can move it, akshobhya, cannot be moved, okay?

01:16:41.260 --> 01:16:43.260
All right, two more.

01:16:44.140 --> 01:16:46.140
You already said that Geshe-la, yeah.

01:16:48.700 --> 01:16:56.380
dak me nyi tokpay sher chin, mr. word, dak me nyi tokpay sher kyi para chenpa,

01:16:59.580 --> 01:17:01.580
dak me,

01:17:02.540 --> 01:17:05.180
yeah, no self-nature, okay?

01:17:06.300 --> 01:17:09.420
It means nothing has any nature of its own. Fire is not hot

01:17:11.100 --> 01:17:16.620
by nature, okay? If you have the karma, fire is hot. If you don't have the karma, fire is cold, okay?

01:17:18.060 --> 01:17:23.420
Your husband doesn't have any nature of being mean to you, it's coming from you, okay? Got it?

01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:26.940
There's nothing

01:17:27.340 --> 01:17:29.340
in, nice. I like

01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:33.980
that. Self-existent doesn't pass the waiter test. What's the waiter test, Shampin?

01:17:42.380 --> 01:17:48.060
Yeah, in our translation team in Sedona, when we want to use a word in a translation,

01:17:48.940 --> 01:17:51.100
somebody goes next door to the Mexican restaurant,

01:17:51.820 --> 01:17:53.820
and they say it to them,

01:17:53.900 --> 01:17:58.940
and they say, do you understand what this word means? And they're like, I have no idea. So if you say,

01:17:59.820 --> 01:18:01.820
you know, no self-nature,

01:18:02.460 --> 01:18:04.460
they're like,

01:18:04.940 --> 01:18:09.740
I don't know, I don't know what you're talking about. The waiter will say, I don't know what you're talking about. If you say,

01:18:10.220 --> 01:18:12.220
is there chili in the enchiladas?

01:18:15.020 --> 01:18:19.820
They will say, oh, I know what you mean. It's chili inside the enchilada. What's a Buddhist answer?

01:18:21.420 --> 01:18:23.420
No, it never was.

01:18:24.380 --> 01:18:32.060
So in, I like to sell it as a better word for self-existence.

01:18:33.420 --> 01:18:35.420
Okay, in.

01:18:35.900 --> 01:18:37.900
Heat is not in fire, okay?

01:18:39.180 --> 01:18:41.180
So the tenth

01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:48.460
metaphor, right? The tenth image for bodhichitta is, say, oshadhi.

01:18:49.740 --> 01:18:51.740
Oshadhi.

01:18:51.900 --> 01:18:56.300
I think there's like two Sanskrit words that start with, oh, this is one of them, oshadhi. Oshadhi means,

01:18:57.660 --> 01:18:59.660
in fact, that datura flower

01:19:00.460 --> 01:19:02.300
that grows here.

01:19:02.300 --> 01:19:07.180
The Native Americans used to eat it for religion, for religious purpose.

01:19:07.820 --> 01:19:09.420
Then they will get

01:19:09.420 --> 01:19:11.660
some visions, like ayahuasca, something like that.

01:19:12.300 --> 01:19:14.300
So the name for that is oshadhi.

01:19:15.580 --> 01:19:18.140
In Tibetan, it's called men chenpo.

01:19:19.100 --> 01:19:22.220
Men means herb, okay? But here it means

01:19:23.340 --> 01:19:28.780
like a psychotropic herb, something like that. Okay, oshadhi. It's in the yoga sutra.

01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:32.140
One of the reasons for

01:19:32.780 --> 01:19:35.260
unusual experiences that are false, okay?

01:19:36.220 --> 01:19:38.220
Anyway,

01:19:40.780 --> 01:19:45.980
shejay chepa ne rab du shiro chepa. Here it means medicine, okay? Herb,

01:19:46.540 --> 01:19:49.820
which gives you medicine, which is medicine. So in the old days,

01:19:50.540 --> 01:19:52.620
almost all medicines were taken from plants.

01:19:53.500 --> 01:19:55.820
So this means medicine plant, okay?

01:19:57.260 --> 01:20:04.300
What if you understand the two kinds of no self-nature, okay? What's the two kinds?

01:20:05.660 --> 01:20:08.860
Yeah, people and things, people and things, okay?

01:20:10.460 --> 01:20:11.580
Cool.

01:20:11.580 --> 01:20:13.980
All right, last one, then we'll

01:20:13.980 --> 01:20:15.980
give you an early evening. Yay!

01:20:16.780 --> 01:20:18.780
This is all extra anyway.

01:20:19.820 --> 01:20:22.700
Okay, chu chepa, say mitra.

01:20:23.740 --> 01:20:25.740
What's mitra?

01:20:25.740 --> 01:20:27.740
Friend, okay?

01:20:28.700 --> 01:20:29.740
In

01:20:29.740 --> 01:20:31.740
what name?

01:20:31.740 --> 01:20:32.940
shen yin.

01:20:32.940 --> 01:20:35.740
Then if it's a good friend, dharma friend,

01:20:36.780 --> 01:20:39.900
yeah, ge wei shen yin, which short name is gishi.

01:20:40.220 --> 01:20:46.540
In Sanskrit, it's kalyana mitra, okay? Kalyana mitra, okay?

01:20:47.820 --> 01:20:49.820
So, there are some extra

01:20:50.840 --> 01:20:52.840
perfections that are not in the six,

01:20:53.580 --> 01:20:55.580
and so kapa starts throwing them in here,

01:20:57.660 --> 01:21:01.420
and it means to help people in an unexpected way,

01:21:02.380 --> 01:21:05.500
to help people, we call tap kepa, right?

01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:09.500
upaya, skillful means, okay? I don't know.

01:21:10.860 --> 01:21:13.660
I heard Ken Rinpoche, this is a story about Geshe Lotar,

01:21:14.620 --> 01:21:17.180
when he was young, he liked to eat a lot of momos,

01:21:18.700 --> 01:21:20.700
so,

01:21:21.340 --> 01:21:23.340
not now.

01:21:23.580 --> 01:21:25.740
Ken Rinpoche will

01:21:25.740 --> 01:21:27.740
tell him to make a lot of momos, and they will eat

01:21:28.620 --> 01:21:30.620
a lot of momos, and then,

01:21:31.660 --> 01:21:37.340
this is a story I heard, okay? Then Ken Rinpoche gave him a Tibetan broom, Tibetan broom is about this long,

01:21:38.300 --> 01:21:40.300
and when you use it, you have to bend over.

01:21:42.460 --> 01:21:44.460
You understand?

01:21:44.940 --> 01:21:50.380
He'd give him like ten extra momos, and then he'd say, sweep the floor, and he's like,

01:21:53.580 --> 01:21:55.580
when your belly's really full, it's

01:21:56.300 --> 01:21:59.420
difficult to bend over, okay? So that was a joke.

01:22:00.540 --> 01:22:02.540
Ken Rinpoche used to play on Geshe Lotar,

01:22:03.100 --> 01:22:05.100
it's called the Momo and the Broom.

01:22:05.900 --> 01:22:10.540
Why am I talking about that? That's a tapkepa, what's tapkepa?

01:22:13.180 --> 01:22:15.740
Yeah, skillful means, but what's it mean? Next time he won't

01:22:17.100 --> 01:22:19.980
eat so many, he will hide them and eat them later.

01:22:22.300 --> 01:22:24.300
Okay?

01:22:24.300 --> 01:22:26.380
So that's, a teacher can help you

01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:32.700
unexpectedly, sometimes by hurting you a little bit, okay? And that's called tapkepa, so

01:22:33.660 --> 01:22:35.900
that's the mitra, okay? If the

01:22:37.020 --> 01:22:39.900
Lama really loves you, they will show you tough love,

01:22:40.780 --> 01:22:42.780
tough love, and I,

01:22:42.780 --> 01:22:44.780
you know, Ken Rinpoche rarely,

01:22:45.500 --> 01:22:48.140
he told us, he gave us both bad names.

01:22:49.740 --> 01:22:51.740
I'm not going to tell you Geshe Lotar's bad name,

01:22:55.020 --> 01:22:58.940
but all day long he calls us bad things, you know, and

01:22:58.940 --> 01:23:00.700
and

01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:02.700
we each have several bad names,

01:23:03.340 --> 01:23:05.340
and

01:23:05.340 --> 01:23:11.820
but it means he really loves us, you see, and for me, and you're going to be an ACI teacher,

01:23:13.260 --> 01:23:16.060
the purpose of this course is to become an ACI teacher,

01:23:17.420 --> 01:23:19.420
or Norbert's becoming a parent,

01:23:21.100 --> 01:23:23.100
just had a baby, and

01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:29.100
sometimes you have to be tough on the kids, you know, sometimes you have to be tough on the kids,

01:23:29.740 --> 01:23:31.740
like if they're going to run across the street you should,

01:23:32.860 --> 01:23:36.780
then you should hit them so they don't die, you know, so that's called tough love,

01:23:37.420 --> 01:23:39.980
and our Lama was very good at tough love,

01:23:41.820 --> 01:23:47.420
he always gave us tough love, and you know, I don't think he ever told me I did something right,

01:23:50.220 --> 01:23:52.380
but it keeps me from getting pride, you know,

01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:56.540
so number 11, Bodhisattva,

01:23:57.740 --> 01:23:59.820
this person who loves all living beings,

01:24:00.940 --> 01:24:05.180
they do better tough love than other people do, they are better

01:24:06.140 --> 01:24:09.500
at being tough on the student when the student needs it,

01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:14.380
and if you're not tough on the student they will do something bad, they will hurt themselves,

01:24:15.340 --> 01:24:19.180
so it's called tough love, okay, so when I'm tough to you it's just tough love,

01:24:20.780 --> 01:24:22.780
okay, all right,

01:24:23.180 --> 01:24:25.180
uh,

01:24:26.140 --> 01:24:29.980
those are the first 11, okay, and we'll finish the rest tomorrow,

01:24:31.820 --> 01:24:33.500
tomorrow evening.

01:24:33.500 --> 01:24:37.340
Class eight, uh, oh, we didn't finish the 22, did I?

01:24:38.140 --> 01:24:43.660
Oh man, we can't do all this stuff, uh, let me go find the 22 for you.

01:24:49.580 --> 01:24:52.380
Yeah, let's finish the 22, let's just do everything.

01:24:53.260 --> 01:24:55.260
That's Geshe Michael's system.

01:24:58.460 --> 01:25:04.300
We finished, uh, we're going, this is like way back in class, I don't know, seven is it?

01:25:05.340 --> 01:25:07.340
Uh, it was the

01:25:07.900 --> 01:25:09.900
cool things about Bodhichitta,

01:25:10.540 --> 01:25:11.900
there were

01:25:11.900 --> 01:25:13.100
nine

01:25:13.100 --> 01:25:16.460
in Pabongka, I told you on the homework I would ask for six,

01:25:17.900 --> 01:25:20.700
and then I added 22 more, if you can't get

01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:24.780
six out of 31, then you have a problem, okay?

01:25:25.740 --> 01:25:29.660
So, uh, these are very, very famous, very, very beautiful

01:25:31.100 --> 01:25:33.100
descriptions of Bodhichitta, 22

01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:37.660
characteristics of Bodhichitta, and they are comparing

01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:41.020
Bodhichitta to different objects in the world,

01:25:41.740 --> 01:25:43.340
like the sun,

01:25:43.340 --> 01:25:45.340
or gold, or things like that.

01:25:45.980 --> 01:25:47.980
So we just finished number 11,

01:25:48.620 --> 01:25:50.620
who can tell me what it was?

01:25:51.420 --> 01:25:53.420
Huh?

01:25:54.940 --> 01:25:57.660
Mitra, yeah, I think, yeah, good.

01:25:58.540 --> 01:26:01.820
I think it's a good chance to learn 22 Sanskrit words.

01:26:02.460 --> 01:26:04.460
These are very common words,

01:26:05.420 --> 01:26:08.060
if you want I can give you the verse in the Sanskrit,

01:26:09.180 --> 01:26:12.140
and if you're a yoga teacher or something, these are nice to know,

01:26:13.660 --> 01:26:16.060
and it's a nice teaching to learn.

01:26:17.180 --> 01:26:19.580
You just learn those 22 words in Sanskrit,

01:26:20.540 --> 01:26:22.940
and then you're kind of prepared to teach a

01:26:24.060 --> 01:26:26.940
before our yoga class or something, you can share a few of them,

01:26:27.980 --> 01:26:29.500
you know?

01:26:29.500 --> 01:26:31.500
So I, it's kind of a

01:26:31.980 --> 01:26:35.660
extra tool in your ACI teacher toolbox, okay?

01:26:36.540 --> 01:26:38.620
So we finished a friend, Mitra,

01:26:39.500 --> 01:26:41.500
which means, uh,

01:26:42.060 --> 01:26:45.340
you know, a spiritual friend, Kalyana Mitra, okay?

01:26:46.060 --> 01:26:48.060
Who uses unusual

01:26:49.020 --> 01:26:51.020
means to teach people,

01:26:51.500 --> 01:26:53.500
like, I don't know,

01:26:53.900 --> 01:26:55.900
maybe they play rock and roll,

01:26:56.220 --> 01:26:58.220
stuff like that, okay?

01:26:58.780 --> 01:27:02.940
We had a good time in Taiwan, we played rock and roll. Stanley, you got that video yet?

01:27:05.100 --> 01:27:08.380
Can we show it? No, maybe tonight.

01:27:10.380 --> 01:27:12.940
There's a nice video of Stanley doing May Day.

01:27:12.940 --> 01:27:14.940
Okay.

01:27:17.340 --> 01:27:20.700
Okay, uh, I mean the bass player is the best thing,

01:27:21.980 --> 01:27:24.140
but the singer's okay.

01:27:25.020 --> 01:27:27.020
Uh, okay,

01:27:27.260 --> 01:27:29.260
number 12 of the 22

01:27:30.060 --> 01:27:32.060
images for bodhichitta,

01:27:32.060 --> 01:27:34.060
say chintamani.

01:27:34.460 --> 01:27:36.460
Who can tell me?

01:27:36.940 --> 01:27:39.500
Yeah, wish-fulfilling jewel. So in, uh,

01:27:40.300 --> 01:27:43.660
in the Middle East, they have Aladdin, right?

01:27:44.460 --> 01:27:50.940
Aladdin's lamp, and he rubs it and a guy comes out and says, anything you want. There's a really good dirty joke about that

01:27:52.060 --> 01:27:54.060
that I learned in high school.

01:27:54.700 --> 01:27:56.700
So if the boys want to ask me

01:27:57.260 --> 01:27:59.260
later, I won't tell the girls.

01:28:00.780 --> 01:28:03.260
Ask me later, I can't do it on a video.

01:28:03.260 --> 01:28:05.260
Thank you.

01:28:06.460 --> 01:28:08.620
The, just secret boys' meeting, okay?

01:28:10.220 --> 01:28:12.220
It's really funny, but

01:28:12.300 --> 01:28:14.300
okay, even so many years later.

01:28:15.020 --> 01:28:17.740
All right, mon lam kyi par chen dang denpa ni.

01:28:20.060 --> 01:28:27.820
It means a bodhisattva, a person who has bodhichitta, they're especially good at

01:28:28.700 --> 01:28:30.700
prayers, okay? Prayers.

01:28:31.580 --> 01:28:34.700
So, what does it mean, prayers?

01:28:35.660 --> 01:28:37.660
It means their vision

01:28:37.900 --> 01:28:40.380
for the future, okay? I want to be

01:28:41.420 --> 01:28:45.180
a wish-giving jewel. So this jewel, you find it in the,

01:28:46.060 --> 01:28:48.060
in like in the washout here,

01:28:48.380 --> 01:28:50.380
you find a small jewel.

01:28:50.380 --> 01:28:53.660
Then there's a whole ritual, you have to clean it with special saffron water,

01:28:54.300 --> 01:28:56.300
you have to put it on top of a

01:28:56.520 --> 01:28:58.220
religious flag,

01:28:58.220 --> 01:29:00.780
you have to do special prayers to it on a special day,

01:29:01.740 --> 01:29:06.380
and then the jewel will give you anything you want, so these prayers

01:29:07.100 --> 01:29:09.100
or these intentions of a

01:29:09.980 --> 01:29:11.980
of a bodhisattva are

01:29:12.700 --> 01:29:14.700
like a wish-giving jewel, okay? They have

01:29:15.740 --> 01:29:17.740
ideas in mind

01:29:18.060 --> 01:29:21.500
of how they would like to see the world to be, they have a big vision.

01:29:22.620 --> 01:29:24.620
They want to be a wishing

01:29:24.780 --> 01:29:27.900
jewel for people. When people meet me,

01:29:28.860 --> 01:29:32.140
they should get whatever they want, okay? I should be the person

01:29:33.020 --> 01:29:36.460
who gives people anything they want, okay? And that's a wonderful

01:29:37.820 --> 01:29:39.820
feeling.

01:29:40.220 --> 01:29:43.020
If you're a bodhisattva, if you know emptiness, for example,

01:29:44.460 --> 01:29:46.460
if you could teach the pen correctly,

01:29:47.980 --> 01:29:54.780
then you could protect these people after they die. They don't believe buddhism, they don't believe karma,

01:29:55.340 --> 01:29:57.340
they don't believe future life,

01:29:58.540 --> 01:30:04.460
but they are going to come to this day when they die. By the way, the person who was dying did die yesterday

01:30:05.420 --> 01:30:07.580
in the hospital, and

01:30:09.260 --> 01:30:13.340
you know, I went and taught them the pen a couple weeks ago, so

01:30:15.980 --> 01:30:19.020
then you're like a wishing jewel, you have something to give them, right?

01:30:19.660 --> 01:30:23.660
Even they didn't expect it, okay? Even they didn't expect it,

01:30:24.780 --> 01:30:27.420
you can give them something precious for their life.

01:30:28.220 --> 01:30:29.740
And that's

01:30:29.740 --> 01:30:33.260
probably the best thing you will ever do in your life, okay? You can give people money,

01:30:33.980 --> 01:30:35.980
or love, or attention, or

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
classes, but if you can

01:30:39.660 --> 01:30:43.020
protect them in the moment of their death, if you can be a wishing jewel

01:30:43.980 --> 01:30:48.540
in that moment, then that's a valuable thing, okay? That's probably the best thing you ever did.

01:30:49.260 --> 01:30:51.260
Just the pen.

01:30:51.980 --> 01:30:53.980
Okay.

01:30:54.700 --> 01:31:01.420
Number 13 is called arka, arka, and this is an ancient word for sun, okay?

01:31:03.180 --> 01:31:05.180
This is an ancient word for sun.

01:31:06.140 --> 01:31:12.060
What's the usual word, word? I don't remember. Surya. Yeah, arka is the old word, okay?

01:31:14.460 --> 01:31:16.940
And this is called the perfection of power,

01:31:19.020 --> 01:31:21.020
which is like the sun,

01:31:21.660 --> 01:31:23.660
and it means

01:31:23.820 --> 01:31:25.740
a bodhisattva,

01:31:25.740 --> 01:31:27.740
a person who has bodhichitta.

01:31:28.780 --> 01:31:30.380
When you

01:31:30.380 --> 01:31:32.380
really develop this wish,

01:31:33.020 --> 01:31:38.940
and even as a sugarcane bodhichitta, okay? Tell me what's a sugarcane bodhichitta.

01:31:41.740 --> 01:31:45.900
Yeah, you just came to the class and the teacher taught it to you. That's

01:31:46.680 --> 01:31:48.680
sugarcane skin.

01:31:49.340 --> 01:31:51.340
Then if you go home,

01:31:52.300 --> 01:31:56.380
think about it in the car, think about it in the airplane pretty deeply,

01:31:58.220 --> 01:32:01.340
before you feel it, before you feel it a hundred percent,

01:32:02.540 --> 01:32:04.700
you can still help people a lot. The power

01:32:05.900 --> 01:32:07.900
of that wish changes you,

01:32:08.860 --> 01:32:12.860
and you become like the sun, so when you're in a room

01:32:13.980 --> 01:32:16.140
with other people,

01:32:16.140 --> 01:32:18.140
they are like the crops,

01:32:18.540 --> 01:32:21.020
and you are like the sunlight, so one sun

01:32:22.220 --> 01:32:24.220
shines over this earth,

01:32:24.700 --> 01:32:26.700
and it causes

01:32:26.700 --> 01:32:28.700
rice to grow, it causes

01:32:29.340 --> 01:32:30.860
trees to grow,

01:32:30.860 --> 01:32:32.860
it causes cactuses to grow,

01:32:34.060 --> 01:32:36.300
it burns bald people's heads,

01:32:37.500 --> 01:32:39.500
right, JB? And

01:32:40.860 --> 01:32:47.900
it's powerful, okay? So if you have bodhichitta, and you're just in a room with somebody,

01:32:48.780 --> 01:32:50.780
you are helping them to grow

01:32:51.340 --> 01:32:53.340
because you are like the sun, you are arka,

01:32:54.140 --> 01:32:56.140
you are like the sun, and

01:32:56.540 --> 01:32:58.060
you are

01:32:58.060 --> 01:33:00.060
inspiring them,

01:33:00.460 --> 01:33:03.420
you are pushing them to grow. You can't spend time

01:33:05.100 --> 01:33:07.180
in a room with a person

01:33:09.100 --> 01:33:10.620
whose main

01:33:10.620 --> 01:33:13.100
job in life is to help the whole universe,

01:33:14.060 --> 01:33:18.540
and it doesn't change you, you see, if you stand near the sun,

01:33:20.060 --> 01:33:22.060
something's going to change inside you, okay?

01:33:22.940 --> 01:33:24.940
So if you have bodhichitta,

01:33:25.500 --> 01:33:27.260
you have this powerful

01:33:27.260 --> 01:33:32.460
effect on other people, so arka is the topki parchen, okay, the perfection of power,

01:33:33.420 --> 01:33:35.420
okay, just by your presence

01:33:36.460 --> 01:33:40.620
you inspire people, you change them, they grow by being around you, okay?

01:33:41.340 --> 01:33:42.860
kho ma,

01:33:42.860 --> 01:33:44.860
all right,

01:33:45.980 --> 01:33:47.980
number

01:33:48.060 --> 01:33:50.060
14, gita,

01:33:50.540 --> 01:33:52.540
gita, what's gita?

01:33:53.180 --> 01:33:57.100
Sang, like Bhagavad Gita, song of the Blessed One, okay?

01:33:57.820 --> 01:33:59.820
So gita means song,

01:34:00.380 --> 01:34:02.380
and this is called yeshe kyi parchen,

01:34:03.180 --> 01:34:04.540
the

01:34:04.540 --> 01:34:06.940
perfection of understanding, okay?

01:34:07.660 --> 01:34:10.380
And then they say, if you really understand

01:34:11.500 --> 01:34:12.940
emptiness,

01:34:12.940 --> 01:34:20.540
and you talk about it to other people, it's like the song of the Gandharva, Gandharva, okay? Gandharva means, do you know?

01:34:21.180 --> 01:34:23.180
Yeah, heavenly

01:34:23.640 --> 01:34:26.940
musician, they live in the Buddha paradises,

01:34:27.660 --> 01:34:29.660
and they play rock and roll there,

01:34:30.780 --> 01:34:32.780
especially in 1970s,

01:34:33.340 --> 01:34:35.340
late 60s,

01:34:35.740 --> 01:34:37.740
late 60s,

01:34:37.980 --> 01:34:40.700
they especially like Neil Young, and

01:34:42.300 --> 01:34:46.060
so these are divine musicians, so if you

01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:52.140
understand this thing about the nose and the face, if you can explain it to somebody,

01:34:52.860 --> 01:34:54.860
that's the sweetest song

01:34:55.340 --> 01:34:58.540
in the world, that's the sweetest song you can sing to somebody,

01:34:59.420 --> 01:35:01.420
and people

01:35:01.420 --> 01:35:04.860
on a deep level, when they're around the bodhisattva,

01:35:05.980 --> 01:35:08.540
and the bodhisattva's talking about those seeds,

01:35:11.340 --> 01:35:20.060
it's very sweet to them, it's very sweet to them, on a subconscious level, unconscious level, they respond, okay? So

01:35:22.220 --> 01:35:25.740
it's always okay to irritate someone with talking about the pen, okay?

01:35:27.820 --> 01:35:29.820
On a plane, or

01:35:29.980 --> 01:35:33.740
people ask me, you know, what's your name on the plane? I say, did you hear about the pen?

01:35:36.380 --> 01:35:40.140
So I figure if the plane blows up and I die in the next 10 minutes, and

01:35:40.940 --> 01:35:47.420
it's good I die talking about the pen, okay? So sing this song, learn this song, it's almost as good as jump,

01:35:49.260 --> 01:35:51.260
learn to sing this song,

01:35:51.340 --> 01:35:55.020
and people respond to it, even when they don't want to,

01:35:56.540 --> 01:35:58.540
even when they don't believe you,

01:35:58.860 --> 01:36:00.860
some part of them

01:36:01.100 --> 01:36:04.540
says, oh this makes sense, you know, this explains the whole world,

01:36:05.420 --> 01:36:07.900
okay? So sing this sweet song, don't be shy

01:36:09.100 --> 01:36:13.340
to sing the song, even if you sing this song lousy, it's better than other songs,

01:36:14.220 --> 01:36:16.220
so even if you can't sing very good,

01:36:18.860 --> 01:36:23.180
if you sing it, it's better than other songs, okay? You can practice in the shower,

01:36:23.500 --> 01:36:30.620
I love singing in the shower, Veronica hates it, so, okay, no, she likes it.

01:36:32.700 --> 01:36:37.580
Okay, 15, oh this is a long one,

01:36:42.860 --> 01:36:44.860
let me see here, it has

01:36:44.860 --> 01:36:46.860
in the

01:36:48.860 --> 01:36:50.860
seven,

01:36:51.180 --> 01:36:56.220
it has seven different parts, okay, saying nerpa, nerpa,

01:36:57.740 --> 01:36:59.900
it means king, okay?

01:37:01.660 --> 01:37:05.660
Nerpa, ner is the ancient word for man,

01:37:08.380 --> 01:37:12.220
and it became used in capital T, the man,

01:37:13.180 --> 01:37:15.900
so, yeah, neropa,

01:37:17.980 --> 01:37:25.500
yeah, neropa got the name neropa from his teacher, that's a long story, if you want to know, talk to Hasu.

01:37:29.100 --> 01:37:31.100
I can't talk about it in public,

01:37:32.780 --> 01:37:34.780
but Nero, the

01:37:34.940 --> 01:37:36.220
Roman

01:37:36.220 --> 01:37:38.300
emperor, Nero, that comes from ner,

01:37:39.100 --> 01:37:41.500
that word comes from ner, so nerpa means king,

01:37:43.180 --> 01:37:49.740
and this refers to what we call ngunpa shepa, a bisnya, which means

01:37:51.820 --> 01:37:53.660
your power

01:37:53.660 --> 01:37:55.740
to know things that are hidden

01:37:56.620 --> 01:37:58.620
is like a king,

01:37:58.620 --> 01:38:00.620
and no one can stop you

01:38:01.740 --> 01:38:04.540
from anything you want to know, okay?

01:38:05.260 --> 01:38:08.220
That's the meaning of a sangha's name, right? Tokme,

01:38:09.180 --> 01:38:14.380
nothing can stop your wisdom, okay? Your understanding cuts through all things,

01:38:16.140 --> 01:38:18.220
your

01:38:18.220 --> 01:38:20.220
insight into things

01:38:20.860 --> 01:38:26.620
cannot be stopped, your mind is like the king, the king doesn't have to ask permission to go anywhere,

01:38:27.740 --> 01:38:33.580
the king can walk into anybody's bedroom, okay? This is the old time king, okay? King in India

01:38:34.540 --> 01:38:40.860
was not like president, okay? The king can do any terrible thing, and people have to smile and say, sure,

01:38:41.660 --> 01:38:47.980
you know, king says, I want your breakfast, you know, you're about to eat some cornflakes, and king's like, I want that.

01:38:49.500 --> 01:38:51.980
In ancient India, the king owns everything,

01:38:52.940 --> 01:38:58.620
also the people, the king can say, I like your daughter, she should come to the palace tomorrow, you know, and

01:38:59.500 --> 01:39:01.500
so no one can refuse the king,

01:39:02.140 --> 01:39:04.300
and if you understand seeds,

01:39:06.460 --> 01:39:08.460
they can go anywhere, you see what I mean?

01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:14.860
Understanding of seeds can walk into the room of any beautiful or irritating object,

01:39:16.220 --> 01:39:19.980
okay? And explain it, okay? So it's unstoppable,

01:39:21.100 --> 01:39:23.100
okay? Your understanding of seeds

01:39:23.900 --> 01:39:27.020
is unstoppable, any irritating person you meet,

01:39:28.540 --> 01:39:30.540
any goal you have to reach,

01:39:31.980 --> 01:39:39.500
this king can go there, no one can stop him, okay? Cool? All right, that's 15, I think, right?

01:39:44.700 --> 01:39:48.220
16 is called ganja, and it's not the ganja you heard about.

01:39:50.940 --> 01:39:57.340
Okay, I think in modern India ganja means like marijuana or something like that,

01:39:57.740 --> 01:40:04.700
and I've been, I played a concert, sitar concert, at a temple where everybody was,

01:40:06.460 --> 01:40:08.860
there were about 2,000 women in white clothes

01:40:10.060 --> 01:40:16.300
in a temple out in the middle of nowhere, and they were all singing, and they were all doing ganja, and

01:40:18.780 --> 01:40:24.380
the only men allowed in were the musicians, and it was pretty interesting, so anyway,

01:40:25.180 --> 01:40:33.100
okay? This ganja means pang dzu, okay, pang dzu, I don't think you know this word, human dictionary,

01:40:35.500 --> 01:40:39.900
pang dzu means like, it's similar to kosha,

01:40:41.020 --> 01:40:43.260
similar to kosha, what's kosha?

01:40:44.620 --> 01:40:50.460
Yeah, treasure house, like the house where you keep all the money, all the gold, all the jewels, okay?

01:40:50.700 --> 01:40:54.940
And if you have bodhichitta,

01:40:57.020 --> 01:41:05.260
it is like a storehouse, where you keep your gye wa di, gye wo kha, sunam ye shi,

01:41:05.260 --> 01:41:07.980
tso tso shi, sunam and ye shi, what's that mean?

01:41:09.820 --> 01:41:17.900
Yeah, good deeds and wisdom, which become the physical and the mental parts of a buddha, okay?

01:41:17.900 --> 01:41:28.140
So, a bodhisattva is like a bank vault, where they keep the karma that makes buddha body,

01:41:29.340 --> 01:41:35.900
and the karma that makes a buddha mind, so you become like a national treasury

01:41:37.420 --> 01:41:43.980
of Russia, they have one in US, Fort Knox, I don't know, they still have it, I don't know if it

01:41:43.980 --> 01:41:48.620
matters anymore, because nobody cares about it, but it's where they keep all the gold in the

01:41:48.620 --> 01:41:57.580
United States, and you become Fort Knox, you become this super bank of good seeds, okay?

01:41:57.580 --> 01:42:04.940
Which will create buddha's body and buddha's mind, so you are called the bank vault, okay?

01:42:04.940 --> 01:42:13.660
Ganja, okay? Ganja, old meaning of ganja, okay? 17.

01:42:19.820 --> 01:42:22.060
By the way, I'm using Tsongkhapa's

01:42:25.740 --> 01:42:30.780
commentary, okay? And I'm not doing the whole thing, it's longer, but we don't have time.

01:42:31.660 --> 01:42:41.740
Number 17 is called maha-marga, maha-marga, kristin... yeah, the great path, interstate highway,

01:42:43.020 --> 01:42:49.340
highway 10, out here, okay? maha-marga, okay? Interstate highway.

01:42:49.340 --> 01:43:00.780
Okay, that means there are 37 qualities that you will have when you are a buddha,

01:43:01.900 --> 01:43:08.780
and if you have them, you become a highway for other people, other people can drive on you

01:43:09.980 --> 01:43:17.180
to go to enlightenment, okay? So you become the buddha highway for the whole world,

01:43:17.180 --> 01:43:26.380
okay? And they drive on you to reach buddhahood. These 37 qualities, someday we can do them

01:43:27.420 --> 01:43:33.740
slowly, but it's very nice, I think it's the best way to understand what's a buddha,

01:43:34.460 --> 01:43:40.380
not by the form or the bodies, but by the 37 qualities they have, chen chok so dun, okay?

01:43:41.340 --> 01:43:49.260
So once you have these beautiful qualities, which bodhisattvas are already collecting them,

01:43:49.820 --> 01:43:56.140
bodhisattvas are already reaching some of them in a lower way, then as you are

01:43:57.580 --> 01:44:05.420
reaching these different qualities of a buddha, you become a highway, you become a way to help other

01:44:05.500 --> 01:44:10.940
people, and people can drive on you. Sometimes if you're a bodhisattva, it feels like people are

01:44:10.940 --> 01:44:19.500
driving on you, okay? But you're happy, drive on me, it's okay, you get to buddhahood, you know,

01:44:19.500 --> 01:44:30.060
I'll be the road, okay? All right, that's 17. Tibetans have funny corruption words for

01:44:30.300 --> 01:44:37.420
modern words that they don't have in their language. So, like for radio,

01:44:39.340 --> 01:44:47.420
they tried, the government tried to say lung tin, which is wind, wind letter, wind message.

01:44:48.620 --> 01:44:55.020
For typewriter, they tried to do, for computer, they tried dzun num chakpar, which means finger

01:44:55.020 --> 01:45:03.260
pressing iron picture. My friend was on the committee to choose the words, they all completely

01:45:03.260 --> 01:45:12.060
failed, you know, they call kompudra, kompudra and red drill, and why did I talk about that? Oh,

01:45:12.940 --> 01:45:19.180
I didn't know what's the Tibetan word for asphalt, this black road covering that we put here,

01:45:19.660 --> 01:45:25.740
I was bragging to Geshe-la how much money we spent on the asphalt, which was almost a million

01:45:25.740 --> 01:45:32.780
dollars, and we still need 700,000. He, we didn't even ask yesterday because we didn't want you to

01:45:32.780 --> 01:45:39.500
have a heart attack. Anyway, I said, what's the, okay, what's your new word for asphalt? He said,

01:45:39.500 --> 01:45:47.180
alikati, you got real alikati on your road, you know, so you can be the alikati for the whole world,

01:45:48.060 --> 01:45:55.180
okay, they can drive on you, they can use you to get enlightened, okay, that's number 17.

01:45:56.780 --> 01:46:07.180
You become alikati, okay, 18, and it's interesting 18 because it's yana, yana,

01:46:07.900 --> 01:46:14.780
vehicle, okay, now yana can also be,

01:46:17.260 --> 01:46:25.260
well yeah, shumba, Je Tsongkhapa defines it as shumba, if you spell it with a G

01:46:25.260 --> 01:46:34.380
word it becomes young, young person, like jampel shunu is the young aspect of Manjushri,

01:46:35.180 --> 01:46:41.980
but if you spell it with a B, bajuno, it means something you ride like a horse or a donkey,

01:46:42.700 --> 01:46:50.700
okay, that's called shumba. So again, number 18 is yana, and this is the yana in Mahayana,

01:46:50.700 --> 01:46:59.260
Hinayana, okay, and it means people could ride you, and so how is it different from the last one?

01:46:59.900 --> 01:47:07.100
The last one was you can become alikati, that people can ride on to get the 37 qualities of a Buddha,

01:47:07.980 --> 01:47:18.380
18 means your only motivation your whole life is to help other people, so it refers to your

01:47:18.380 --> 01:47:28.700
love, it refers to, specifically ning je, karuna, okay, how much love do you have? Karuna comes

01:47:28.700 --> 01:47:37.820
from, in Russian there's a word krish, shto znachit krisha, krisha, yeah like roof or cover,

01:47:38.300 --> 01:47:47.100
and so karuna, this, Russian is much closer to Sanskrit, so the, also the word for hood of an

01:47:47.100 --> 01:47:55.420
automobile is krisha, and it means cover, meaning you protect people, okay, so karuna,

01:47:57.420 --> 01:48:08.300
compassion is number 18, okay, and that's the yana, okay, you are a horse for the whole world

01:48:09.500 --> 01:48:16.300
because you just love them and you want to take care of them, and that's your only motivation

01:48:16.540 --> 01:48:26.540
all the time, okay, so Nancy, best friend right, for many years in New York is Michael, Michael Wigg,

01:48:27.180 --> 01:48:37.660
who also helped the Dharma in New York for, I don't know, 40 years, and he has a, he had a car, so not

01:48:37.660 --> 01:48:42.860
everybody in New York has a car, you don't need a car in New York, a car is a big hassle, Nancy has

01:48:42.860 --> 01:48:48.540
to get up at four o'clock every morning and move her car according to the, you know, parking

01:48:48.540 --> 01:48:53.580
regulations, if you don't want to pay more than your apartment for the parking the car,

01:48:54.940 --> 01:49:01.260
then you have to move your car around, one day I ran out of gas moving the car, I couldn't find a

01:49:01.260 --> 01:49:11.260
parking spot, and anyway, Rinpoche had a nickname for Michael's car, which is chi pay ta,

01:49:12.700 --> 01:49:21.500
chi pay ta, it means a public horse, you know, because he would always give you a ride, or he drove

01:49:21.500 --> 01:49:28.700
around every lama, whoever visited New York City, he was the driver, he's extremely kind, he's a

01:49:28.780 --> 01:49:36.540
really bodhi, sakpa type, and he would always give you a ride, it didn't matter what time,

01:49:36.540 --> 01:49:43.900
didn't matter how far you had to go, so Rinpoche gave him a nickname, public horse, chi pay ta,

01:49:45.180 --> 01:49:51.500
this led to the famous incident where he was looking for a parking space, I was with him in

01:49:51.500 --> 01:49:59.500
the car, and we found one, it's like finding a gold mine, and here's this big empty parking space,

01:49:59.500 --> 01:50:07.100
you know, and he drives by, and I'm like, Michael, what, what are you doing, you know, he says,

01:50:08.380 --> 01:50:14.140
I don't want to use up the karma, I'm like, we have to talk about karma.

01:50:14.860 --> 01:50:27.580
Anyway, number 18 is chi pay ta, you become yana, you become public horse, okay, and it's because

01:50:27.580 --> 01:50:33.660
your motivation is, it's like Michael, you just want to help people, and you can call him anytime,

01:50:33.660 --> 01:50:41.420
night or day, and he will drive you somewhere, okay, still, I'll give you his phone number, okay,

01:50:44.460 --> 01:50:49.900
Stanley's like, yay. Okay, 19.

01:50:55.180 --> 01:51:07.500
This one's long, I'm sorry, okay, say prasravana udaka, prasravana udaka, and it means,

01:51:08.460 --> 01:51:12.700
let me get this screen, it means, we have a spring up here,

01:51:14.060 --> 01:51:18.700
spring means water comes naturally under the ground, comes out, it's running right now,

01:51:18.700 --> 01:51:26.060
you should go see it, it doesn't run all the time, and it's very beautiful, and that's why they built

01:51:26.060 --> 01:51:33.980
this fort here, because it's one of the only springs in southern Arizona where you can get free water,

01:51:33.980 --> 01:51:41.820
and it's, so it's a big deal, somehow the mountain shape is like a bowl, and it collects

01:51:41.820 --> 01:51:48.140
all the water underground, and then it comes out here, and there was actually many wars here

01:51:49.580 --> 01:51:56.060
between people for the water, so it's running right now, it's a very beautiful experience in the

01:51:56.060 --> 01:52:02.780
desert to see it, so if you like, come up to the ranch house and spend some time by the spring,

01:52:02.780 --> 01:52:11.660
it's a very beautiful place to sit and meditate, it's very calming, okay? Anyway, you'll never have time.

01:52:15.740 --> 01:52:23.180
And it means you, two qualities, mi je pe sung, say mi je pe sung.

01:52:23.660 --> 01:52:34.620
If you meditate a lot and you practice a lot, there comes a time in your life where you remember

01:52:35.500 --> 01:52:44.140
precisely every teaching you ever had, okay? The video, you can play back the video, any video

01:52:45.020 --> 01:52:50.540
of teachings you heard, and it's kind of beautiful, you know,

01:52:51.580 --> 01:52:57.820
unexpected memories come in your mind of something your teacher said 20, 30 years ago,

01:52:58.940 --> 01:53:07.500
and I always think of it as a synapse firing unexpectedly, like the electricity in the mind

01:53:07.500 --> 01:53:12.300
goes, and then you remember, you know, somebody stood and asked you,

01:53:13.180 --> 01:53:21.980
what's mi je pe sung, and you go, and or words from Russian class in Princeton University in 1970,

01:53:23.180 --> 01:53:28.620
sometimes when I'm in Moscow, I say, you know, like some weird word, and everybody's like, wow, and I'm

01:53:28.620 --> 01:53:36.380
like, yeah, I didn't think of this word for 30 years, 40 years, you know, I can't remember it right now,

01:53:38.140 --> 01:53:45.980
but sometimes it happens that words just come in your mind, and so if you have, sung means mantra, jo,

01:53:48.380 --> 01:53:56.540
and mi je pa means never forget, so there comes a time in your meditation when you can access

01:53:57.420 --> 01:54:01.580
all the teachings you ever had, so even if you're going to sleep through a teaching, it's good to come,

01:54:01.580 --> 01:54:12.140
okay, because it's still recorded, and you can access the recording later on, okay, don't forget

01:54:12.140 --> 01:54:20.860
that skill we talk about, the ability to sit in class with your eyes open and sleep is very useful.

01:54:21.660 --> 01:54:32.460
Now, connected with that mi je pe sung is tok me che pa, che pe popa, which means the courage

01:54:33.500 --> 01:54:41.980
to explain the Dharma to other people without stopping, so our spring dries up

01:54:43.660 --> 01:54:50.620
half the year or most of the year, but if you have this power, this prasravana udaka,

01:54:51.260 --> 01:55:02.300
udaka means spring, right, prasravana, it will keep coming out, okay, and the emphasis in the metaphor

01:55:03.740 --> 01:55:12.620
is that when you meet a bodhisattva, there's water that came out, but in English we have an idiom,

01:55:12.620 --> 01:55:17.820
it means that there's a lot more where that came from, there's a lot more where that came from,

01:55:17.820 --> 01:55:25.660
so the emphasis on this metaphor of you are like a spring for other people, the emphasis is

01:55:27.340 --> 01:55:33.500
there's a lot of teachings you're giving now to them, people can see your current teaching,

01:55:34.220 --> 01:55:42.700
but there's a lot more where that came from because of your mi je pe sung, because of your mantra,

01:55:42.700 --> 01:55:50.780
sorry, your sung can also mean like magic, you have this synapse magic, okay, so there's a lot

01:55:50.780 --> 01:55:57.020
more in the subconscious of a bodhisattva that they can share with you because they reach that

01:55:57.020 --> 01:56:04.860
level in meditation where the water will keep flowing, so this little tiny spring you see here

01:56:04.860 --> 01:56:12.140
at Diamond Mountain, which cost the lives of many people, this building we put the roof on,

01:56:13.100 --> 01:56:18.380
what do you call it nowadays? Ranch house, if you go there there's windows like this,

01:56:19.740 --> 01:56:26.780
there's a window shaped like this, that was for shooting people, that house was built during the

01:56:26.780 --> 01:56:36.860
wars here, and so the spring you can see is a little water, but it's coming from an ocean

01:56:36.860 --> 01:56:47.420
underground, okay, the whole mountain range here has a huge ocean of water underground, and so when

01:56:47.420 --> 01:56:55.180
you meet a bodhisattva, what they're teaching is like the spring, but it also refers to the underground

01:56:55.180 --> 01:57:01.740
water, there's an ocean behind it, okay, because they remember everything they were taught before, okay.

01:57:04.140 --> 01:57:10.780
All right, what number are we on? I'm just checking to make sure you're awake, yeah, 20 am I right?

01:57:10.780 --> 01:57:17.020
Let me see, let me see,

01:57:21.020 --> 01:57:31.340
anandokti, anandokti, so it's ananda and ukti, okay, ananda, ukti, ukti means expression,

01:57:31.740 --> 01:57:43.260
ananda means happy, okay, super happy, ah, ah, prefix in Sanskrit means super, long a, ah, okay, you have to say ah,

01:57:44.460 --> 01:57:55.180
and ananda means happy, so ananda means super happy, ananda means unhappy, so don't call the

01:57:55.260 --> 01:58:04.780
Buddha's disciple ananda, he's ananda, okay, Mr. Super Happy, it really, it's one of my, what, Masha?

01:58:06.060 --> 01:58:15.820
It's one of my pet peeves in yoga class when they say something like ahinsa, which means super violent,

01:58:16.540 --> 01:58:21.740
okay, let's see here,

01:58:26.700 --> 01:58:35.740
this again refers to a sweet song, kung gawe dra, kung gawe dra, okay, it means the sound that

01:58:35.740 --> 01:58:46.380
everyone likes to hear, this talking about saving the world, talking about getting out of pain,

01:58:47.420 --> 01:58:54.140
talking about, look, being honest with people, you know, you're going to die, it's kind of weird to

01:58:54.140 --> 01:59:00.220
meet somebody, you know, you get invited to a class and you walk in and you say, hey, you're going to die,

01:59:00.220 --> 01:59:08.220
then they're like, whoa, but part of them is happy, ananda, part of them is happy, because

01:59:09.020 --> 01:59:14.220
someone's telling the truth, okay, someone's telling the truth, and people aren't stupid,

01:59:15.260 --> 01:59:21.500
you know, after your grandmother dies and, you know, your first aunt dies on you, and your pet dog

01:59:21.500 --> 01:59:30.540
dies, and then you get the picture, you're usually about six years old or something,

01:59:30.540 --> 01:59:38.140
people aren't stupid, so if you walk in and you start talking about death honestly, directly,

01:59:39.260 --> 01:59:46.780
then it actually sounds like a kung gawe dra nyen, you can call it by the way the

01:59:46.780 --> 02:00:01.980
guitar, dra nyen can mean lute or a guitar, okay, like that, violin, okay, a musical instrument,

02:00:01.980 --> 02:00:08.460
okay, you can think of number 20 as like a musical instrument, okay, and

02:00:12.140 --> 02:00:15.260
we have a joke, okay, I'm just going to tell you so you can remember,

02:00:15.260 --> 02:00:25.100
say kung ga dundrup, so kung ga means annanda, dundrup means siddhartha, okay, siddhartha,

02:00:25.820 --> 02:00:33.740
so kung ga means everybody loves him or her, and siddhartha means achieves all goals,

02:00:34.460 --> 02:00:39.420
can achieve every goal, so sometimes in the monastery a rich person comes to visit,

02:00:40.380 --> 02:00:47.740
and the monks have secret language to ask, do they have much money for the monastery,

02:00:49.020 --> 02:00:56.140
okay, I'm sorry, it happens, and they'll say, is this person annanda siddhartha?

02:00:57.740 --> 02:01:05.500
And the people go, yeah, they say, okay, let's take good care of him, okay, so annanda means

02:01:05.740 --> 02:01:13.260
everyone likes it, siddhartha means achieves all goals, that's siddhartha's name, what does it mean?

02:01:14.220 --> 02:01:23.260
Money, okay, so if we start talking about annanda siddhartha you know what we're talking about, okay,

02:01:26.300 --> 02:01:33.180
of course the way you ask a person for sponsorship, and it should be straightforward and honest,

02:01:34.060 --> 02:01:40.780
but you can still make jokes about it, it's okay, okay, that's our lineage, right? Fun lineage,

02:01:40.780 --> 02:01:54.780
okay, all right, two more to go, twenty-one. The Sanskrit is, sorry, where did I put that?

02:01:55.340 --> 02:02:01.260
Hang on, I got to look it up for you,

02:02:08.620 --> 02:02:17.100
oh, nadi, let's say nadi, okay, nadi means jing, like, what do you call,

02:02:17.100 --> 02:02:30.380
jongmai, right, nadi, it means a river, okay, river, okay, it means a river, nadi, but it can also

02:02:30.380 --> 02:02:40.140
mean a channel where the prana flows, okay, nadi, okay, and there's lots of rivers in the world that

02:02:40.140 --> 02:02:51.260
have the root nadi, I think Danipa is one, so, this is interesting,

02:02:59.020 --> 02:03:06.460
because it means all rivers go to the same ocean, it means all rivers go to the same ocean,

02:03:06.700 --> 02:03:12.060
and there's a very beautiful teaching, which we should do sometime, when we don't have anything

02:03:12.060 --> 02:03:24.940
else to do, which say, ta thuk, tekpa chik, ta thuk, tekpa chik, in the end it's all one path, in the

02:03:24.940 --> 02:03:34.380
end it's all one path, and that's a big debate in Prajnaparamita, okay, topic number four, huge, huge

02:03:34.940 --> 02:03:43.500
debate, you know, and there are tantric vows, high tantric vows, against criticizing other religions,

02:03:43.500 --> 02:03:53.500
okay, if you become a high Buddhist teacher, ACI teacher, we are still not allowed to criticize

02:03:53.500 --> 02:04:01.420
other religions in the world, because they all flow to the same ocean, okay, if you follow that

02:04:02.380 --> 02:04:08.460
water, nadi, you will reach the same place, okay, sooner or later you will reach the same place,

02:04:09.340 --> 02:04:17.980
so, you know, love other religions, appreciate them, study them, I studied Koran for two months

02:04:17.980 --> 02:04:27.900
in Morocco, it was very beautiful, and you know, learn about them a little bit, and appreciate

02:04:27.900 --> 02:04:35.740
them and love them, in the end they flow to the same place, so never criticize, it kind of shows

02:04:35.740 --> 02:04:42.700
you don't know anything if you criticize other religions, okay, okay, it's all nadi, it's all one

02:04:43.980 --> 02:04:50.060
stream, and the bodhisattva understands that, okay, and they will use other religions,

02:04:51.820 --> 02:04:56.940
my best-selling book in the world is a book about the yoga sutra, okay, which I don't believe in,

02:04:57.900 --> 02:05:09.500
I mean, unless it gets reinterpreted, but you use other religions, learn other religions,

02:05:10.140 --> 02:05:20.620
master them, be interested in them, respect them, okay, and you'll be glad that you did, okay,

02:05:20.700 --> 02:05:27.340
okay, 22, and then we'll take a break, and we have to prepare for Geshe-la,

02:05:29.340 --> 02:05:40.220
number 22, Megha, Megha, which means cloud, a cloud in the sky, okay, this is the Sanskrit,

02:05:40.220 --> 02:05:50.460
and this is cool, when you become a bodhisattva, so in Buddhism, in ancient India,

02:05:52.780 --> 02:05:59.820
they believe that the gods drop the rain from the sky, you know, so if it doesn't rain in your state,

02:06:01.260 --> 02:06:04.460
you have to, you know, do a ceremony and ask the

02:06:05.420 --> 02:06:12.700
gods in the sky, please drop some more rain, you know, so those gods became known as,

02:06:13.900 --> 02:06:22.220
like Megha, so there will come a time as a bodhisattva when you are sitting in your Buddha paradise,

02:06:23.260 --> 02:06:29.420
and please drop some rain on us, okay, whoever gets there first in this room, okay, let's make a

02:06:29.420 --> 02:06:37.340
deal right now, okay, I'm not a Buddha, I'm really not, I would like to be, but let's make an

02:06:37.340 --> 02:06:45.740
agreement, okay, everybody, whoever gets there first, you drop some rain on them, drop some dharma on

02:06:45.740 --> 02:06:54.220
the rest of us, everybody agree? Yeah, mazal, okay, deal, so whoever gets there first, drop some

02:06:54.300 --> 02:06:59.980
rain on the rest, drop some dharma, okay, let me and John know so we can put our hat on,

02:07:01.180 --> 02:07:12.540
it's really irritating, so we have a deal, whoever gets there first, you know, drop some rain on us

02:07:12.540 --> 02:07:18.620
from your Buddha paradise, cool, and that's why the bodhisattva is called the cloud, okay, cool,

02:07:18.700 --> 02:07:30.060
okay, all right, we finished two classes ago, and we'll work hard tonight to finish everything,

02:07:30.060 --> 02:07:40.380
and Tim will be happy, okay, who's got the sushi, Alina?

02:07:40.380 --> 02:07:44.140
Vegetarian.
